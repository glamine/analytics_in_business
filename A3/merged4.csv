62319795;I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer;R237DVEX5MFFQ6;5;"I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review.Today’s Nonfiction review is on I’ll be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer by Michelle McNamara. It is 352 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is a dark picture of a house with gold highlights. The intended reader is someone who is interested in true crime and long running mysteries. There is foul language, discussion of rape and violence in this book. The story is pieced to together from first person interviews and police reports.From the dust jacket- A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.\You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark.\""For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called \""the Golden State Killer.\"" Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.Review- This is a compelling and terrifying read about a horrible killer who has still not been caught. McNamara was obsessed with this killer and with someone, anyone, getting him off the streets and in jail for his crimes.  McNamara was a wonderful writer was fascinated with true crime when a neighbor was murdered near her home and that killer was never caught either.  So McNamara started a blog called True Crime Dairy and that started everything. Her very untimely death cut short a amazing writer, and I think someone who could have caught the Gold State Killer. McNamara gives the crimes a timeline, the victims voices, and the cops, who are still hunted the GSK, a place to talk and be heard. She does not gloss over the horror of the crimes but she does not give too much detail about the blood and gore. We know what happened without having to see in our minds when it's time to sleep. If you are interesting in true crime, then treat yourself and read this book.I give this book a Five out of Five stars.""";There is foul language, discussion of rape and violence in this ...;larainey;1557356610

62319795;I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer;R3QS9EUR4VYLN8;4;Bu far the most interesting character in this book was Michelle herself. I found the end difficult to read, it didn’t feel complete due to her untimely death. It was extremely compelling to learn more about how these investigations are carried out, the small details that I would overlook, but that fixated her, and how she unpacked them.

62319795;I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer;R1YZ74NJBAZRSV;5;I am a fan of true crime. This book chronicles the investigation of the dubbed but uncaught, Golden State Killer. The book is Ann Rule..ish.  It is a mesmerizing account of what is so far known of the case by Michelle McNamara, a writer/investigator who has sadly passed away.  Since she had not finished her writing of the book, parts were pieced together by her researchers based on her many articles on the case as well as her notes in addition to what she had already written. I found the autobiographical sections of the book most compelling.  The author’s personal journey in trying to capture the Golden State Killer was gripping.  For anyone who fancies her/himself an amateur sleuth, this book is a vicarious investigative trip through the experience of an obsessed and dedicated reporter.  I sincerely hope her steadfast probe will payoff in the identification and capture of the Golden State Killer.;A Compelling, Investigative Trip Through the Experience of an Obsessed and Dedicated Reporter;Claudine Wolk;1556802075

62319795;I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer;R2O6QGFQ84EA4J;1;I read this book with an open mind but it is probably the worst True Crime book I have ever read.The book began interestingly enough and I thought I would really like it.  Then, the writing became disjointed, and in the second half of the book, the writing was largely undertaken by the author's colleagues and family members after her untimely passing.  As a result, the second half of the book was boring and tedious.The author never gets to see the Golden State Killer apprehended by justice, which does happen after the author has passed.  Unfortunately, I can see no link between the author's theories and what actually transpired.The book should have included an Afterword where the details of the killer's arrest are revealed.  Instead, we get a letter written by the author to the still at-large killer questioning his humanity and scolding him for being a coward.  Really?  That's it?;Ultimately disappointing!;Amazon Customer;1557197670

62319795;I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer;R2GM5JKMPS75TC;5;"I listened to the audio book because I have a long commute and could not put it down, I would find any down minute I was continuing to listen, it was so good.  I was fascinated about the writer's obsession in her selfless quest to help find this guy, at the expense of her family that she loved very much, and ultimately her life. I cannot help but think it was her obsession that led to her overdose, mixing prescriptions that she should not have mixed coupled with an undiagnosed heart problem, etc.  The book reads more like a memoir, you either like that or don't. I rather liked it because I feel like the reader is able to get a sense of the person she was.  I enjoyed little glimpses into her personal life because it helps explain her obsession and I got the feeling repeatedly she would be the kind of person I would pick as a friend. I enjoyed her writing style immensely.  I have read a lot of reviews complaining she jumps around and there is not a real timeline and that she had a lot of information on some cases but not on others.  When reading this book you should probably keep in mind the following: She passed away before the killer was caught and before her book was completed; this book probably followed the timeline of her investigation --not crimes; as far as how much information she had on each, I assume it depended on the information she was given or was available.  You have to remember she was a writer working on a huge unsolved cold case with only cooperating law enforcement, many of the original of which had retired, etc.  Regardless, I really enjoyed the book, it was fascinating and well written.  I wish she could have seen the day this guy was arrested, it really breaks my heart she didn't.";Fascinating true crime meets memoir. I loved it.;Mandy B.L.;1556581662

She was obsessed with trying to identify the killer.  There were many dead ends and false suspects.  No detail was too small for McNamara to analyze.  Were there clues the investigators had overlooked?  Was there a connection no one had noticed?McNamara was driven by \an intense curiosity, a compulsion to solve a puzzle and resolve the bone-chilling blank spots.\""McNamara died unexpectedly on April 21, 2016.  At the time, she had 3,500 computer files and 37 boxes of files from the Orange County prosecutor on the case.She seemed to be close to resolving the identity of The Golden State Killer.  Two years after her death, California authorities arrested a suspect thought to be The Golden State Killer.  Although McNamara's fans credited her work for the arrest, the Sacramento County Sheriff said the book played no role in the arrest.Readers interested in true crime will definitely find the book enthralling.

What truly frightened her and kept her awake at night was the fact that the Golden State Killer has gotten away with his 10 year reign of terror and is possibly blending into society as someone's husband or dad now.Yes, McNamara was obsessed with her search for the monster. If you read even a small item about this killer/rapist, I doubt you can remain content to leave it at that. It is impossibly frustrating in this day of DNA instant matching that the creep could still be walking the streets. She rightfully felt until the day she died that she was on the verge of identifying the killer, probably through an Ancestry.com like site.A true-crime blogger, McNamara knew she was obsessed with GSK and does not hold back the introspective criticism. She knows herself and she understands people on a level that most of us don't. The seasoned and weary criminalists on the case came to appreciate, even rely on her skills. She, in turn, relied heavily on crowd-sourcing and advanced technology to help in the relentless search.She writes impressively about the victims, the survivors and the detectives involved. She articulates the many (50) cases in bite-sized chunks and does not glorify nor hold back the details. It is a terrifying book, yet full of compassion and understanding for the victims.My mouth continually fell open and my head was shaking NO as I listened to this moving account from one woman with an enormous investigation to relate to the public.

62664484;The Border: A Novel (Power of the Dog);R11LJJPB9TSEY;3;I have always loved Action-Adventure. Even when it stuffs a few dozen expletives, I plow through this genre so I can experience the action or enjoy the adventure. On rare occasions, however, such tomes will so vastly overdo the profanities that the action and adventure becomes lost in the forest of expletives. “The Border” by Don Winslow, for some, is such a novel.POV:-BLUSH FACTOR: With more than 400 eff words, I think it safe to state, you will not be reading this to your youngsters, your prayer group or to anybody else. There also are what can be regarded as crude sex scenes. Even if there were no profanities, you wouldn’t be reading this to friends and family.Well, if you will be, I don’t think you and I live on the same planet…WRITING & EDITING: Aside from the language, the writing is excellent. Short, snappy, easy to read. Further, and more to the point, the hero, Art Keller is the hero many of us aspire to emulate. He’s tough, smart, quick and, well, everything most of us are not. That probably explains why I continued to read this thriller despite any misgivings.Yes, I admit it, I am a hopeless throwback to our chauvinistic cave man days. Sentimentally, in spirit, if not in actuality.BOTTOM LINEGreat writing? No. But, for those who like this genre, it is a decent read. I’m actually between three and four stars.Three stars out of five.I am striving to produce reviews that help you find books that you want, or avoid books that you wish to avoid. With your help, my improvement will help other readers find books they enjoy reading.;Fans of Gritty Action-Adventure Will Love This, BUT…;Andy Anderson;1557149334

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R80I40OZ87RKU;2;I listened to the audio version.  And if ever a book was not well suited to audio, it's this one.  At about the half way point, the story really beins to drag.  Because of the flashbacks where plot explanations occur, I wasn't able to simply fast forward since I might miss something important.  So I literally suffered through hours where I wanted to throttle the narrator.  Overlong, over explained, over acted.  I often listen to a book before going to bed at night.  Couldn't do it with this one as I ended up impatient and annoyed.  I predict the movie version may very well work, and maybe reading the book where you can skim pages isn't as frustrating.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R1UY8I3OEF5HUB;3;I wanted to like this story more. The writing was very good, but at times repetitive and dragging. This book is a good contribution to the psycho-thriller genre, but it was more intriguing than suspenseful or thrilling. On one hand, it reminded me of all the wonderful psychological thrillers of the 1990s (Sleeping with the Enemy, etc) and more recently of Gone Girl and Girl on a Train. It has the same flavor. But both of those books had me on edge. Reading this one, however, my pulse didn’t race at all. I predicted the family twist from the beginning. Her behavior was rather odd if there wasn’t something else going on there. The second twist was also fairly easy to discern. My wavering on what happened was only caused by the unreliable narrator and another clueless character. This had me wondering what I should believe, if anything at all. When the twists were finally revealed, I felt more annoyed with Anna Fox than satisfied as a reader. The final twist was also rather predictable...because of odd behavior on the part of characters. All of that said, this book held my interest once it finally got going, and I wanted to know the ending (even if I knew what was coming).;I wanted to like this story more;nbajema;1557150663

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R2Q928GTXKGP9V;4;So, A. J. Finn is actually Dan Mallory, who worked in publishing for Morrow and Little, Brown UK.  He uses a gender-free pseudonym for various reasons, one of which is to keep his authors (i.e. the authors whose books he acquired) to keep from freaking out if and when they see his actual name on a jacket in a window display or a point-of-purchase rack.  He likes French bulldogs, suffered for years from clinical depression, dislikes President Trump, is gay and now, a millionaire.  THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is this year’s GONE GIRL and THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, the latter owing great debts (along with THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW) to Hitchcock’s REAR WINDOW.  The film of the novel is due out in fall, 2019, with Amy Adams in the title role and Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore supporting.  Can you say mucho dinero?But what of the book?  I seldom read best-sellers because they generally fall short of expectations.  While unique in their sales they are often derivative in their conceptions.  That is certainly true of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW but the book did hold my attention.  It was well-plotted, contained some interesting characters, and was set in the now-gentrified Harlem.  It is a psychological thriller.  We learn this from the jacket design, promotional material and blurbs from practitioners of the genre.  The narrative itself, however, could have gone in any one of several directions: horror, amateur sleuth or even mainstream fiction.  Since the narrator is unreliable, a switcheroo twist and/or ending could have presented us with a very different form of story.  One possibility, e.g.: the challenged person whose traumatic experience forces her out of her comfort zone and into a bit of personal redemption, as in, e.g., MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN or THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.  Bottom line: the book draws on a number of potential (well-selling) antecedents.The concept:  Anna Fox is a child psychologist who has suffered a great deal of personal trauma.  She is now agoraphobic, confined to her multi-level home, where she lives with a cat named Punch and multiple cases of Merlot, which she mixes indiscriminately with a variety of strong medicines.  Often woozy and bored, she plays online chess, logs on to a site for agoraphobics and looks out her windows, utilizing the long lens of a camera (just like Jimmy Stewart) rather than a pair of binoculars.  On one such occasion she witnesses the murder of a woman she has recently met.  Or does she?  Is she simply delusional?  Does she have evil, ulterior motives?  Is everyone else wrong while she is right (even though drunk and, more or less, addicted)?Her interactions with a number of individuals (neighbors, a tenant, therapists of various types, police) constitute the principal plot arc.  The story, as expected, has multiple unexpected twists and turns and the ending contains key surprise elements.The book is ‘long’ and physically weighty, but it reads very quickly because it principally consists of dialogue and contains very short chapters with a great deal of white space.  The writing is brisk and highly competent but there is very little actual psychological or philosophic weight.  This is a best-seller that has mass-market appeal, not a book that you are likely to re-read.  (And not just because of the ending.  THE GREAT GATSBY has a surprise ending, but we re-read it constantly.)My advice: if this is your cup of tea, relish it.Four stars (but actually three and a half).;This year's best-selling psychological thriller;Richard B.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R3M8W6JPU5XD62;1;Frey's book was put forward as autobiography, this is sort of the reverse. This book retails the actual author's  sociopathic behavior and pretensions in the form of a thriller. I am sorry to see Stephen King gave it a blurb, as did the New Yorker. Please read the New Yorker profile of the actual author, Dan Mallory.  Aside from the mendaciousness involved in producing and selling this book, the writing truly is bad, the first couple of pages are barely at the level of supermarket romance trash.;Remember Frey, 'A Million Little Pieces'..?;L.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R1MIZULEMZSIM6;5;Wow, what a fabulous book. This one definitely kept my attention. Fast-paced and oozing with suspense. Complex characters I wanted to root for. Well written, with beautiful descriptions that make this book stand out heads above the rest. Anna Fox talks to Ed. He talks to her. These family scenes are heart-wrenching and it's easy for a reader to empathize with Anna's condition, how she got there, why she self-medicates. Their story is as much of a mystery as the woman in the window and the suspense is ratcheted up by three questions. Who is Anna's biggest threat? The woman she sees. Herself. Or someone else entirely. I never thought the ending would unspool in such a dramatic way. What a twist!What I didn't like: the excessive drinking. I felt, at times, it detracted from the story. But considering what Anna had gone through, it wasn't completely out of place.I bought the hardback version at a book store, so although it might not appear to be a verified purchase here, it was. I think I read it in two days which is fast for me considering how much life gets in the way. A.J. Finn will definitely be an author to watch.;Fabulous book.;Bookpreneur;1557215006

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R31BRKDRH9DYRW;5;"Anna has problems. It's been nearly a year since she left her house. Not as hard these days with so many things being bought online and delivered to your door. Obviously there are things that she does need to go outside and do, putting the rubbish out for one, but for these, she has a lodger.So, what does a person do all day if she can't go out. Yes, that's right, she spies on her neighbours. Making up names and backstories where she does not know the truth and keeping careful watch of what they all get up to on a daily basis. She's not casual about it by any means. In fact you could consider her dedication to her watching, even dipping into the realm of voyeurism on occasion.And then, one day, she hears a scream coming from the Russell's house, and she sees what she thinks could be a rather nasty crime. But looks can be deceiving, especially if the watcher isn't exactly sober at the time, which is basically the police's attitude to the whole thing, backed up by the rest of the members of the household. Did Anna really see what she thought she saw and, if so, why are the Russell's lying?Basically, this book is a updated re-imagining of the wonderful Rear Window. A well loved Hitchcock film based on a short story. But there are as many similarities as there are differences, especially with the plot and here, this book really excels. As with the majority of this genre of book, we have all the usual key plot elements front and centre. Secrets, lies, duplicitous behaviour, assumption, unreliability, mental health issues, you name it, it's here. But, never does the book come across as \psychological thriller by numbers\"" each element warrants inclusion and is seamlessly injected into the plot perfectly.To say that Anna is a bit of a complex character would be the understatement of the year. Wow, she really has got herself into a bit of a pickle, even before seeing what she believes she saw. From the start, we know there is something that triggered all this off. Brought it to a head so to speak but it is not until much later that we found out what. And my heart bled as I read on with tears in my eyes. OK, I get a bit emotionally involved with well described, believable, wounded characters.The atmosphere described by the author was suspenseful, indeed claustrophobic at times, especially as Anna's paranoia started to escalate. There were a few occasions where the action was physical but, what with Anna not being so mobile, these were few compared with the cerebral level of intrigue the author wove throughout. It was also quite a visual book for me, unusually so, and I also think it would transfer to screen very well (but please don't kill it).All in all, a cracking book which looks to be a debut - surely not! One which grabbed me from the first page, held me captive throughout, leaving me spent but satisfied at the end. I really can't wait to see what the author serves up next time.My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book.""";The Woman in the Window;Ashrae;1556615155

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RCT89SATFEXGI;3;"2.5 starsRetelling of Rear Window(1954) with James Stewart and Grace Kelly, minus the charm... this round the housebound main character is an unlikable female agoraphobic and former child psychologist who has given up on the outside world after a tragic event.  She drinks too much wine, is whacked on meds, possibly hallucinating, pushy AF, lurks a great deal on the Internet, and spends an obnoxious amount of time being a smack-worthy nosy neighbor via her windows... a seemingly unreliable narrator who may or may not have witnessed a murder by her neighbor across the way.Kind of a despicable protagonist I never really took to.  Helpless and weak.  Her judgement is extremely poor--outright stupid-- and this made me wish she'd get institutionalized or that someone would just take her out.  Her \Dr.\"" title was farcical.  Moreover, unlike Rear Window, no one here in this cast takes the place of Grace Kelly (who had more of a spine for a 1954 woman than the hot mess in this 21st century book)... just meh chemistry with Bina (a woman who shows up for exercise), neighbor Jane Russell, her tenant David, and Ethan, the teenage neighbor.  Grace Kelly's dynamic with the older Stewart as they chat and scheme and occasionally fool around was one of the best things about the movie.  This here is just some old movie fanboy fanfic. Though much like Rear Window... one does wonder why people don't close their dang blinds when they're up to no good!!!  Who is that dumb????  Implausible!!!  This book picks up the worst of Rear Window and ignores the best.  I just didn't care about any of these people.I did like all the descriptive language and all the nods to old movies, though.  \""Jane Russell\"" was a nice touch, ha ha.  Nothing particularly original here plot-wise but engaging enough plot (I didn't say characters) due to the competent writing.  It's a serviceable retelling that could make for a half decent new movie based on the old (author already has a movie deal)... but ultimately telling of Hollywood's inability to come up with new material.  Does it rate all the attention it's getting?  Nope. Just one of those new releases that goes viral but isn't really great or original... amazing how often this happens.  An okay read but definitely overhyped.  If you look at the author's résumé you'll see he's gotta have friends in high places... you do the math.""";retelling of Hitchcock's Rear Window;Amazon Customer;1556582935

I found this book to be so poorly written,  and the plot predictable.  It unabashedly borrows from Rear Window, but  without the suspense and tension. The lead character is so unlikable, and makes poor choices considering her education, and profession (she is a therapist!)  and one gets so tired of her pill popping, and drinking.  I am not sure why all those descriptions are necessary, maybe because there is not much else to say in the book and apparently no other way to move the plot forward and create the disbelief on the other characters' parts.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R2Q7124HKANIJN;3;"Okay, so the most surprising thing I discovered about the book is that is the author is a man. I would not have guessed that. As for the story... A. J. Finn is a fantastic writer with a smart, humorous turn of phrase, an author who can definitely conjure up an interesting premise. So why only 3.5 stars (and 3, not 4, if I have to go one way or the other)? There are two major plot twists--the one concerning Anna's family was completely transparent, right down to the basic 911 of what occurred \that night.\"" The author did \""get me\"" on the major plot twist. My issue was that by the time we got to the reveal, I didn't care that much anymore. I was over the drunk unreliable narrator (honestly, can there be no other plausible avenue for this type of narrator than falling down drunk?), and I was so worn out from the two-steps forward, three-steps back gone-wrong life of Anna Fox, I was merely glad to see that the whodunit was cleverer than I'd imaged. It was a tossup between the bottles of merlot and endless Hitchcock references as to which one repeated ten-times too many. The book could have easily lost 50 pages if just this had been dialed back. Overall, the book was worth the read, the witty writing and intriguing clues, which did keep me turning pages.""";Give me a decimal, 3.5. Good, entertaining.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R144DMP86WONUN;5;Anna Fox's life has been reduced to popping pills and consuming bottles of wine. An agoraphobic, she spends her days watching old black and white movies, drinking wine and watching the neighbors. A Hitchcock style book, The Woman in the Window kept me wondering what was actual and what was imaginary, sustaining my attention throughout its entirety.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R239RPAZYN6V51;4;Anna Fox hasn't left her New York City home in months. She spends her days drinking and watching her favorite classic movies. She enjoys seeing what her neighbors are up to by spying on them through her window. After a married couple and their teenage son move in to the neighborhood, Anna sees something terrifying through her window. But with a reputation as a crazy, drunk recluse, will anyone believe anything Anna has to say?For me, this book was almost identical to the reading experience I had with The Girl on the Train. Both of the main characters are miserable depressing people and you spend much of the time questioning if they are a reliable narrator. I didn't think there were any truly shocking plot twists but each book held my interest throughout. I'd say definitely give this book a shot if you like mystery/suspense novels but give this book a pass if you hated The Girl on the Train.I won a free copy of this book from the publisher but was under no obligation to post a review.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R97VFJ42AGKGZ;2;Hitchcock once said he tells stories about real life but with the boring parts left out. So did Hammett, Chandler, Christie, and many other contemporary mystery writers with whom this writer claims to be familiar. Regrettably, Finn has chosen to include the boring parts throughout this tedious, diary-style novel of agoraphobia, alcoholism, psychosis, and drug addiction. The slender plot is nearly eclipsed by the heroine’s relentless mental fog. For me, great writing, as life, is in the journey not the destination.;A Weak First Attempt;RoccocoMan;1556606233

If you've read that book or seen the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, then you know exactly how this book will end.  That's no groundbreaking twist (since it was already done). The story is unoriginal. The narrator/main character is a pathetic, whining, drunk, and I often experienced second hand embarrassment for her. She was sad, yes, clinically depressed, but sad, as in, you could only pity the poor woman. I'm tired of writers characterizing women like this. She reminds me of the narrator from Girl On The Train. Just a hot mess. As for the book itself, it was painfully slow, it took forever to get anywhere with the plot. All the character does in the first half is watch her neighbors from her house, drink wine, pop pills, watch old black and white movies, and pass out. Rinse, wash, and repeat. It's just painfully slow and so bad. I stuck it out to see if the book and the character would redeem themselves. To see if Anna could be vindicated; maybe she wasn't crazy after all. But, no, the book borrowed it's whole twist and I was let down for having wasted my time on such a well reviewed novel. I wrote this to warn others. Get another book.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R20PX8ZTXELH7H;5;"Dr. Anna Fox has not left her house in almost a year.  She has gone from being a strong, confident woman who worked as a child psychologist to a nervous, anxiety-wrecked woman who can't make herself open the door and go outside.  She has gone from a woman with a loving marriage and a child to one who doesn't live with her family anymore and talks to them occasionally.  Anna spends her days playing online chess, talking on the agoraphobic message forums, watching old movies and drinking way too much wine.Her other past time is watching her neighbors from her window.  She knows their schedules, who is having an affair and whose children are growing up and headed off to college.  When a new family moves in across from her, she is fascinated by them.  There is a father, mother and one teenage son.  She meets the son who is shy but charming, then the mother.  Both seem a bit reserved and perhaps a bit afraid of the father whom Anna suspects of being controlling.  Then one night Anna looks out at their house and sees something she should not have and it changes everything.  No one believes her as her insecurities and general strangeness are well-known but she knows what she saw.  Can she make someone believe her before it all ends in tragedy?This is a debut novel and it has arrived with a huge splash.  It has already been bought and is being developed as a major motion picture.  It is being published in more than thirty languages and has garnered great reviews.  It is reminiscent of the best Hitchcock movies; a twisty psychological story that keeps the reader guessing until the very end.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R1F9C76Z31M997;3;Somebody needs to explain the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist to Mr. Finn.  As much of the narrative depends on the Anna Fox's sixth sense as a psychologist and her actual ability to reorder her prescriptions and that she has denied Adderall to patients in the past, Mr. Finn ought to know that a psychologist cannot write an RX for patients.  Actually, there is a distracting give and take in the novel where Anna can sometimes prescribe and then admits that she cannot prescribe.  Is this the true crime of the book? Or is the true crime that this is being hailed as the top thriller of 2018?  maybe both.The book is redeemed by a surprising twist somewhere in the middle which reminded me of the movie The Sixth Sense and also there was no cliche red herrings or a love story.  You can stop reading at the somewhat surprising reveal as the book then begins to devolve.  I was also curious as to where Anna was able to maintain her 4 story townhouse in Harlem without working and another income..... this was not explained, it does get annoying when you find yourself wondering about a fictious character's finances.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RTEP6U27L7WC6;5;I go through mystery/thrillers like I go through napkins, contact solution, and conditioner, and I thought I was pretty good at seeing the endings of them from a mile away. Enter A.J. Finn.This book gets 5 stars from me for the writing alone. Just enough details to hook you into the novel but enough left out to keep you trying to piece things together. It's like trying to assemble a puzzle without ever seeing the picture on the box. Our leading lady, Anna, is smart, observant, and sort of funny enough to be likeable, but also a chronic alcoholic who mixes her dosages and is plagued by a severe agoraphobia. I found myself wanting to believe in Anna yet I knew better than that. Despite her brilliant, albeit doubtlessly unreliable, mind, her life is an absolute train wreck and Finn delivers the juicy details for readers to absorb with an almost vouyeristic glee. The lovely prose from her perspective feels like indulging in a monologue from a friend who's made (more than) a few questionable decisions in short period of time.I'll spare the details of the plot. The twists and turns in this book were delightful and I'm not too proud to say that the ending came as a horrible (in the best way possible) surprise.In short, this is the kind of book that keeps you engrossed for the short time you read it (I can't imagine taking more than two days to read this, the curiosity it breeds is compelling), and leaves you pleasantly surprised (maybe even shocked) when it's over.Also, you'll never think of Romance by Ralph Lauren the same way again after finishing this.;This will keep you busy for a good couple of hours;Monica;1557273341

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R1RW8W13HYXL1;4;"Summary:A recluse with agoraphobia, Anna Fox spends her days watching old movies, drinking way too much, and spying on her neighbors.  When the perfect family moves across the park, she can't look away.  A father, mother and teen son; the Russells seem to have it all.  One night, though, Anna sees something that she shouldn't... and it all unravels.  Misdirection, lies and deceit... she knows what she saw... or does she?  Is it possible too much wine and too many pills combined with old movies have created a crazy scenario?  How can she know- and who can she go to for help?  Is anyone else- is she- in danger?  And who is pulling the strings here?My thoughts:I loved this book for a lot of reasons.  Every time I felt like I knew where things were going, the story veered off leading me to somewhere new.  I had an inkling a few times about what was going on, but I didn't want to believe it.  There were so many scenarios that could have fit!  The character development was amazing.  Even the characters I hated, like Anna and David, were intensely interesting and wonderfully multi-faceted.   I felt for Anna, having been a psychologist she wanted so badly to help others, to heal others even as she could not heal herself that she often went too far and did too much out of desire to be of assistance.  I also felt that her trauma and pain were well done.  For me, this was a four and a half star book, with an extra star for originality.On the adult content scale, there is a high level of violence, language, and some sexual content.  This is definitely geared toward adults.  I give it an eight.";When the perfect family moves across the park;Amber Garabrandt;1556617855

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RBUV3FK1ZOW0Z;4;I won’t take your time providing a plot summary of The Woman In The Window, as this is provided well enough in the Amazon Book Description above. Instead, I’ll use this review to let you know why I found it to be an entertaining read, but not a book I think is deserving of all the hype it has received. It is a book, however, that a think will satisfy many thriller/mystery lovers — provided that they “don’t set their sites too high.”On the plus side, first-time novelist, A.J. Finn does a good job in establishing a slow-building, tension-mounting plot that not only effectively pays tribute to Hitchcock’s classic movie, Rear Window,  he also does a decent job in reproducing the type of psychological suspense that made the book, The Girl On The Train, a major bestseller. In addition, Finn’s plot intersperses several twists and turns to pique reader interest. Further, Finn’s main character, Anna Fox, an agoraphobic, alcoholic, emotionally-scarred child psychologist, has more than her share of psychological problems to make her an interesting and memorable — although not very likable — flawed character.Seriously competing with these pluses, however, are the following factors which keep me from reacting to The Woman In The Window more positively, and thus recommending it more strongly. In my opinion, Finn spends more than half of the book’s length setting up the plot, paying homage to Hitchcock and old movies, and describing the main character’s problems, which made me find it to be more slow-moving and repetitive than I would have preferred. I think I might have enjoyed the book more if it was 50 or so pages shorter. Further, while several of the secondary characters are interesting enough, I didn’t find them to be developed enough for me to care much about what happens to any of them. And, though the book provides the reader with twists and turns, I rarely found myself on “the edge of my seat” to find out what happens next, and, while the last 75 or so plages provides the book’s “strongest punches,” I found a few of them, and particularly its dramatic ending, tended to strain credulity.3 1/2 stars rounded up to 4 stars.;3 1/2 Stars — A Decent Read But Doesn’t Live Up To All Its Hype!;Bobbewig;1556616115

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R1D6FBGX1GV1H2;4;Author A.J. Finn deftly uses superior character development of agoraphobic Dr. Anna Fox and photographically-detailed descriptions of her environment * to lure readers into engagement, to lull readers into semi-complacent comprehension at certain times, and to ultimately leave readers open-mouthed yet satisfied at the complexly-constructed bombshells in The Woman in the Window. “Good” red herrings are evident. Concatenations of events unobtrusively lead the reader to her/his own conclusions — until, that is, astonishing but not-unreasonable twists dash those judgments. As a Turner Classic Movies junkie, I applaud how this novel pays skillful homage to classic cinematic thrillers. The titles, actors, plots, and even dialogue snippets from these movies not only creatively delineate Dr. Anna's psyche and circumstances, but also nudge the reader toward correct — and a few incorrect — predictions throughout the novel. Although much of the plot is spent in time-shifting, alcohol-and-prescriptive-drug-induced blurs, structurally, the novel hurtles forward: physical chapters are brief and often semi-cliff-hanging, urging the reader to read just a few pages more. **In summary, The Woman in the Window is a compact, sophisticated chiller with a complex, fully-realized main character and enough sly plot twists to catch the reader off-guard, but admiringly so.*Read the book to see what I did there....** Notably, I voluntarily increased my treadmill time while reading this book at the gym.;Compact, Sophisticated Chiller;Dee Bee;1557259577

In the meantime, she enjoys more than a few cocktails, old noir flicks, and her favorite past time...spying on her neighbors in their multi-million dollar mansions. A new family moves in across the house from hers. The woman of the house introduces herself to Anna and they spend an evening drinking, playing chess and chatting. Later that night, drunk on wine and watching an old flick, Anna decides to also spy on the new neighbors only to find a grizzly crime scene unfold at the new residence.Anna calls for the police, leaves the house and faints from an anxiety attack. Later, no one believes her. Did she dream it up—watching one to many flicks and drinking too much? Or is Anna behind gas-lighted? The truth is cleverly disguised and there is only one way to find out....   Beautiful scenes, clever descriptions and likeable characters revealing deep, horrible truths.

The touted Hitchcockian/film noir connection isn't some subtle, creepy building of suspense that comes at you on little cat feet--it's literally the protagonist watching classic thriller films and reciting the dialogue to herself. Color me noir. The plot is ripped directly from soap opera territory (\""Desperate Housewives,\"" anyone?), which isn't necessarily a terrible thing--there are only so many storylines in the world, but original? It was trope decades ago and now, frankly, it's tripe. Ultimately, this book is problematic for me not because it's terrible (the writing IMO is fine, the protagonist and supporting characters are fine), but because it's a huge, monster hit.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R33S71I9G6AOT4;3;"I became really engaged with this book from the beginning, and I was invested in the forlorn story of an agoraphobic woman whose husband had left her alone with her collection of vintage movies. Isolated and unhappy, she starts to live out the plot of Rear Window (that particular movie is not mentioned) by piecing together stories about her neighbours through her extraordinarily good view from her window. Whoever approved the alignment of those houses should be castigated for giving such easy viewing pleasure.Surprise, surprise, she witnesses a murder and launches into one of those creepy Hitchcock situations where nobody will believe her. This is where the story becomes implausible, with one of the most polarised and unrealistic \good cop, bad cop\"" routines ever. Police might be cynical and overworked, but they don't spend hours talking over some woman who is trying to report a crime. They don't give a nuisance witness their direct numbers so she can call them at 2 in the morning. They don't tell the witness in front of a potential suspect that she's crazy. They either investigate briefly, or they nod politely and go onto the next real crime. Also witness statements are shaky at best, so nothing beats visiting the scene of the alleged crime to check for physical evidence. This complete absence of any physical evidence or any other independent witness reports creates a glaring gap in the story.By the time the villain was revealed, it was an anti-climax, especially as the villain delivered a long monologue gleefully describing every stereotypical life event that led -- to choose evil as a career path.""";Good start, but unconvincing characters and disappointing end;Kirsten;1556803025

But, I’m pleased to announce that this time, rare though it may be, I was not at all disappointed!The writing quality was wonderful, really natural, great flow, I caught the first wave and rode it all the way to the end. Smartly written with a plot that I’ve not encountered before: the main character, Dr. Anna Fox (psychologist), who believes she has witnessed a crime, is a lock in, agoraphobic as a result of some tragedy (the details of which are parsed out in bits throughout the book). Her mental health issues make her a questionable witness, and being the only witness, the police don’t believe her. But Dr. Fox is sure of what she saw, and does what she can, within the confines of her home, to try and figure out what’s really going on.Other elements of the story were clever and entertaining: the misdirects were well done, and the story of Dr. Fox’s past was just as intriguing as the mystery she was trying to solve. However, there was one bit that I highly suspected early on, but only because I’ve recently read a book with the same “surprise”. I’d mention the book, but then you’d know what I’m talking about, and spoilers are no fun. ;)Not quite a nail-biter, but a compelling story nonetheless.

The author Daniel Mallory (his real name, not AJ Finn) was the VP of the publishing house which published this book & gave him a $2 million deal.(from the NY Times: Having read most of the book in one sitting, it was only when Ms. Brehl pitched it to William Morrow publisher Liate Stehlik, that she learned it had been written by their own colleague, Mr. Mallory, then the vice president and executive editor of William Morrow.) Kind of like insider trading. Cheating, really.But back to the book. It slogs along with Endless descriptions of Anna drinking, being drunk, taking pills, drinking, sloshing wine on her robe, sloshing wine into a glass, looking out of the window drunk.She is unable to leave her house. There is a shock about 2/3 of the way through the book which explains why.But really the ending is so torturous, it's as if Mallory tried out 3 different endings, all based on other books or movies (Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train, Body Heat, Gaslight etc. etc.)And the \bad guy\"" does what all too many bad guys do--talks & talks & talks so long, telling the story in detail so that Anna is able to (won't do a spoiler)I really don't like books written in the present tense. It's a popular style right now but I don't like it. I read all the way through, hoping to find Anna in AA at the end & some light shed on the neighbors. Thankfully, the mystery IS explained (unlike in many current books which end with a fizzle). So cheers to Mallory for That.I think he could have edited out about 30 pages, mostly about the drunken imagery. If he'd done that, this would have been a really good book""";Too much like The Girl on the Train;Dix88;1556720035

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RK9VLHF4TWG2X;4;This falls into the category of hard to put down — the suspense is unrelenting.  And there are so many twists and turns that, as soon as you think you’ve reached a point where you understand where things are going . . . . ZAP!  Your head is twisted around, and you have to go on to find out what just happened.  And by the time you find that out, the same thing happens again, and again.  You get the picture.The unreliable first person narrative thriller is practically a genre of its own now.  And the structure works very well for that kind of head-snapping, never-sure-where-things-stand suspense.  If the narrator doesn’t know what’s going on, how could the reader?Throw into the mix a main character, Anna Fox, who is suffering from agoraphobia and pieces together her world through her view from the windows of her four story Harlem house.  Anna is a child psychologist, traumatized by the sudden end to her family life — she lives alone, now without her husband and daughter.  She spends her days drinking and self-medicating.  She goes online, trying to help others as best she can as a housebound psychologist.  And she watches an endless collection of noir movies.As a child psychologist, she’s naturally interested in the goings on across the park, in a house where a couple live with their teenage son, Ethan.  And she sees something — what appears to be a woman’s murder in that house — just as Jimmy Stewart sees in Rear Window.  But she only sees what she sees.  Does she know what really happened?  Is her drinking, her mix of medication and alcohol, and her general condition, making her believe she’s seen and experienced things she hasn’t really seen?  Now we’re mixing Rear Window with Gaslight.  And, with her cooped up in the house, there’s a little bit of Lady in a Cage and Wait Until Dark thrown in for good measure.The play between what’s happening in Anna’s life and the films she watches is one thing that takes the book beyond formula thriller.  Not that there’s anything wrong with formula thrillers, when the formula is well-implemented, as it is here.And the first person narrative works as well.  We inhabit Anna.  We share her self-doubt, and her resolve to expose what really has happened in the house across the park.  We feel her frustration when she pulls in the police, who doubt her story, think she’s either hallucinating or trying to get attention.  And we doubt her story, as she does, when the doubters seem to have credibility on their side.It’s a good exercise in determining what’s real, when all we have to go on are unreliable witnesses, until the undeniable appears.It’s not “great literature”, but I think it’s more than thriller of the month.  There’s good stuff here.  And you won’t be bored for a second.;More Than Thriller of the Month;Doctor Moss;1556614015

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R2ZBBW0TGJUAQW;4;Wow! Just finished this psychological thriller. It is the author's first novel.I don't usually do audible books but I had a free trial  on audible so I decided on this one. I love the printed word so I may have given this a 5 star if I had read the printed version. Had a hard time putting  this one down and  listened way too late into the night. There were lots of twists and turns in the book that I did not see coming.Despite the main character's(Anna Fox) alcohol consumption and pill popping I still liked her.. flaws and all. Her life was in tatters for very good reasons but she was a survivor.The reader of the audible version did a good job. Her tone at certain parts of the novel had you on pins and needles.  I especially liked the references to the black and white films that Anna was constantly referring to(quotes and all) I had seen a lot of them especially the Hitchcock ones.Would like to re watch some of these great films. At the end of the audible version the author explains his struggles with depression so he definitely knew the subject while writing this novel. He has another psychological thriller he is writing. It set in San Francisco. Will be waiting for that one for sure. Meanwhile I hope Hollywood makes a movie of The Woman in the Window Then again I should be careful what I wish for as the movie is never as good as the book.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R2Y00URVUXRCMC;4;Readers of the Woman in the Window by AJ Finn first encounter its main character, Anna Fox, as she spies on her new neighbors from her large vintage home in Harlem.  Anna, a former child psychologist, is debilitated by a severe case of agoraphobia combined with PTSD caused by a recent, unspecified traumatic experience.  Told from her perspective, the story captures her sense of confinement and extreme anxiety.  Cut off from the outside world, Anna only has limited contact with care providers, her currently absent husband and daughter, and her downstairs tenant.  Her greatest source of connection and self-esteem comes from an online support group of her fellow sufferers.  She spends her days on her computer, watching old black and white films, drinking wine and watching out her window.  Reminiscent of the film Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock, Anna is also the sole witness to a heinous crime being committed.  Due to her mental illness and substance use, no one believes her version of events and her own motives are called into question.  As the mystery of the crime unfolds, details about the circumstances that lead to Anna’s condition are revealed-casting even more doubt on Anna’s reliability as a witness and as a narrator. Rife with tension and some interesting and surprising twists, the Woman in the Window is a solid page-turner, despite its limited setting and small group of developed characters. This book would make for a good summer read, especially during a stormy night.;Solid Noir Page-Turner;JNMEgan;1556609935

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R10JP4HIIT4ZLF;4;A multitude of old black and white movies is a theme running thru this book and the plot pays homage to the same.  Anna Fox,our protagonist suffers from agoraphobia resulting from a devastating and initially undisclosed incident that has damaged her deeply.  The major players are drawn with depth and breadth portraying people I could identify with or against and gave me serious skin in the game.  A successful author once said the writer's job is to get the hero up a tree and then set the tree on fire. A.J. Finn truly sets that tree burning. The first quarter of the book introduces us to the major players growing tension slowly but steadily-you know the drill.  By the 60% mark I was fully invested and rooting for Anna.  Things go from bad to worse and her back gets firmly slammed against the wall.  A.J. Finn's writing works because of the passion he brings to the table because he has suffered from the same affliction. As a fellow recluse myself the details ring true from taking out the trash to stocking the frig or getting thin emotional sustenance from the internet. Its refreshing to read a book that assumes I am intelligent,well informed and capable of catching the occasional nuance thrown my way. He's got my vote.;Solid debut from an author with promise;Barry Melius;1557250993

I have a taste for quality writing by people like Margaret Atwood, Janet Frame and also writers like Anita Shreve. I really don't think A J Finn should write his next book using the device of a woman's voice as it really sounds like a dude in drag. I'm sure he will do fine otherwise, but the way it (probably PR, rather than a genuine journalist initiated interview) came across through a reputable main stream media story, I was expecting something of much higher quality. I watched Gone Girl and enjoyed it.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RD2A7HTEK6N4F;3;For the past couple weeks I have been on this Adult Thriller binge and have started listening/requesting all the things. And when this one started getting hot in the blogosphere, I knew I had to request this one too.Anna Fox does not come out of her house. She spends her time drinking wine, watching old movies, and talking to her husband and child. She has another hobby that one day gets her into a bit of trouble.... Spying on her neighbors. One night while Anna is spying on her new neighbors, she sees something that turns her entire world upside down. What is real and what isn't? And how does she know what isn't?I really enjoyed the concept of this book. Granted I don't want to find out about my neighbors spying on me, but I really loved finding out about Anna and how she accidentally sees what she sees. I really liked the way the mystery is played out as well. For the life of me I could not figure out who that person was until the very minute Anna did too!However, I am so over this idea in adult thrillers that the only way to make the narrator unreliable is to make sure they are an alcoholic or super high on some kind of meds. The Woman in Cabin 10, Girl on the Train, and this one are only a few of the thrillers I've read, and they all start out the same. Makes me not want to read them anymore. (I think I DNF'ed The Woman in Cabin 10 for this exact reason smh) Can we PLEASE find some other way to make the narrator unreliable? (Also if you read adult thrillers and know of some where the narrator is found to be unreliable but in ways other than being drunk or high, please send them to me!)As for the mystery, I thought it was pretty solid. Although I figured out who the culprit was super early on, (probably on 6 out of 11 discs) I wasn't exactly sure what had happened or how they had done it. It seemed a bit predictable, but then once you get comfortable and think you know everything, YOU DON'T.I decided to review this one here because there is a teen in this book. There is a lot of interaction with him as well so I can see this being a good crossover book for older teens interested in this type of thing. (I say this because I would have more than likely read this when I was a teen, but keep in mind I didn't discover YA until I was in college with Twilight.)The writing style itself was good, but nothing to write home about. It was easy to follow and definitely made me question and doubt my theories all the time. It also starts off pretty slow, but when things get going, they don't slow down.Although there were some things I did not care for, there were also some pretty great things about this too. It always gave me a really exciting drive to and from work and at one point made me happy to sit in the car for an extra 5 minutes to finish that part of the book.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R177TF12QBUO0P;5;"I was getting ready for bed the other night and remembered I had a new mystery to read, hurray!  I thought I would just read a chapter or two, see how the main plot shaped up.  Several hours later, I was thinking hurray, I’m glad I don’t have to go to work today, because it was already the early hours of the next day.  I’d read The Woman in the Window straight through.The title is a nod to Alfred Hitchcock’s film Rear Window, exactly the kind of old movie Dr. Anna Fox loves to watch along with many other, older black and white choices from her DVD collection.  This, chatting with her online support group, and keeping an eye on the comings and goings of her neighbors from her window are her main pastimes, because Anna has not been able to leave her house for a long time.  Her husband and young daughter are gone; she talks to them regularly, but they don’t live together any more.  Anna is crippled, by both her agoraphobia and her discovery that in addition to food, she can have wine by the case delivered right to her doorstep.  Why shouldn’t she drink?  It isn’t as if she’ll be going anywhere.However, when, like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, Anna thinks she may have witnessed a murder from her window, the amount of wine she drinks and the careless way she combines it with her psychotropic medications makes it hard for anyone to take her report seriously.  Even the most sympathetic detective thinks she needs psychiatric help more than she needs a murder investigation, not the least because they have quickly determined that the so-called victim is alive and unharmed.It feels trite to say The Woman in the Window is a page-turner, but it is, in the best way.  It’s well written and cleverly plotted and only becomes more riveting as one and then another loose end is tied up.  Just be careful when you pick it up, because it will be awhile before you can put it down again.";Wow!;Aderyn;1556611555

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RA76B1ZAQU3XR;2;"After all the great hype for The Woman in the Window, I expected a compelling thriller. Instead this novel became a long and drawn out test of my patience while I watched basically nothing happen to a sad alcoholic shut-in who is incapable of doing anything to improve her situation. I could not muster any sympathy for Dr. Anna Fox, who is mired in her misery. And there's no break from her -- she's basically the only person in the novel!It's not interesting. It's depressing and tedious to watch this pathetic character circle the drain, as her life loses all touch with reality.Seriously, even when the Big Event happened, the one that (again) made Anna question her sanity (as she should), it wasn't intriguing. It was exasperating. Not in an \Oh please, tell me what's really going on\"" kind of way, more \""I seriously need a life if I'm considering finishing this book\"".I started flipping pages, looking for content, and found myself glossing over page after page of depressing imagery and ruminations.

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R2IGDPE7H5VPZ5;4;A riveting and remarkable debut psychological suspense thriller with a fascinating main characterSUMMARYDr. Anna Fox, once a successful child psychologist, is now a recluse in her New York City home and unable to venture outside. She has agoraphobia and has been unable to step outside for ten months. She spends her day drinking Merlot, watching old Hitchcock movies, recalling happier times with her family, and spying on her neighbors.  She noticed that a new family, the Russell’s just moved in across the park, a husband, a wife and their teenage son.  One night Anna is checking out the neighbors through her window and she witnesses a act of violence at the Russell house. Was it real? Did she imagine it? Why doesn’t anyone believe her? As she pursues the truth, her world begins to crumble and her secrets are revealed.“Watching is like nature photography: You don’t interfere with the wildlife.”REVIEWTHE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is a heart-pounding psychological thriller that kept me awake late into the night. I was totally immersed in, and riveted by Dr. Anna Fox’s story. Her backstory, her struggle with agoraphobia, her drinking and her inability to discern the truth, all combined to make her a fascinating character that propels the suspense. The pacing of the plot and the short chapters made the book a quick and easy read.A.J. FINN has created an engrossing and sophisticated debut novel that skillfully transports us to a four story house in Harlem. He creatively uses various old movies scenes and chess moves as metaphors, although at times to frequently. There were two small things about the book that gave me pause.  The first was the police’s ability to obtain Dr. Fox’s private medical information from her doctor, regardless of patient confidentiality laws.  The second was the police handling of the questioning and confrontations with Ana, which surprisingly took place in a large group setting, with all the Russell’s present. Although minor, neither of these situations square with what would happen in reality. (I hope!)  Despite not being a huge fan of either Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train, I found this book compelling.  Overall, this was a great blend of characters, setting and story.A. J. FINN is a synonym for Daniel Mallory who was born in New York and is a Oxford graduate and former book critic. He has written for the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post and he is an executive editor for William Morrow which purchased the rights for the book at auction. THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW debuted in January as a #1 New York Times bestseller, an unusual feat for a first time author.  The movie rights were purchased and will star Oscar nominee Amy Adams as Dr. Anna Fox.  It will be filmed in NYC beginning in August 2018, and is set for release October 2019.  I listened to the Audible version of the book and liked the performance by Anne Marie Lee.Publisher  Harper Collins/William MorrowPublication  January 2, 2018Narrated  Ann Marie Lee“And if I don’t want to die, I’ve got to start living.”;Riveting and Remarkable Debut Psychological Thriller;Lisa Harvey;1556582095

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R3OSQIUT8EHXL6;4;"Rating: 3.75/5\Watching is like nature photography: You don’t interfere with the wildlife.\""This book was not what I had expected"; it was no Girl on the Train. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was more than cliffhangers and suspense;"this is a thriller/mystery that also deals with the poignant topics of PTSD, mental illness, alcoholism, loneliness, grief, and more. I chose it as my Book of the Month February selection, and I don't regret it!Anna Fox was a successful child psychologist with a small, happy family until a terrible ordeal caused her to have to abandon her career—her life—and heal, both physically and mentally. She stays locked in her home in Harlem, alone, passing the time by playing online chess, watching old films, drinking a ton of wine, and using her camera to keep up with her neighbors' lives. She knows (or, in some cases, pretends she knows) all of them, but when a new family moves in across the park, she becomes particularly attached to them. It's strange and a bit unhealthy, as you might imagine.Then one day, when she is particularly intoxicated and overly medicated, she witnesses violence in that house. But the next day, there's no evidence to be found, and no one believes her. She is determined to get to the truth of the matter, but her inability to leave her home makes that hard. As we progress through the story, we begin to question everything we'd assumed from page one.\""Some nights I haunt her room like a ghost. Some days I stand in the doorway, watch the slow traffic of dust motes in the sun. Some weeks I don't visit the fourth floor at all, and it starts to melt into memory, like the feel of rain on my skin.\""The Woman in the Window isn't one of those thrillers that get your heart thumping wildly every other page, but it does move along nicely and present mystery after mystery after mystery. Uncovering more about Anna and how she got to her current situation is just as gripping as the mystery across the street. Her obsession with old films helps to emphasize the confusion between what is real and what is not. And about 75% of the way in, there was a plot twist that walloped me";" it was masterfully done, truly.Anna is likable as well as pitiable. Her morals are definitely in the right place—at least at the time the story occurs—even if her execution misses the mark. But she becomes ten times more intriguing after the plot twist. Many times, she questions her own perception of reality, but as the audience, we think we know what's going on. Heh—yeah, right.All in all, a good story and a safe choice for a book you'll enjoy."""

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R147ULHXI63KMN;3;3.75 stars - close to a four star read. I haven’t read many thrillers, but this might be the book that gets me more into the genre.I really liked Anna Fox and halfway through just accepted that she’s a complete mess of a woman (her motto is “I need a drink”) and was just rooting for her to get her life together.  I really liked the old movie references and how they’re constantly playing in the background. It really adds to the classic thriller atmosphere of the novel. Also got some good movie recs out of it. I listened to the audiobook and I enjoyed the narration as well.My only criticisms would be that I called that first plot twist and I thought the ending was rather cheesy and silly. The villain literally monologues how they did it to Anna while lightning flashes across their face. I couldn’t help but laugh. It also has a lot of the same tropes that other well-known books in the genre do, so if you're looking for something completely new and ground-breaking, this isn't it.Overall, I did enjoy this book. The mystery kept me turning the pages, so it’s a fun popcorn thriller. I would recommend it if you’re just starting into the genre and I’m excited to see what AJ Finn writes next.;Good Book To Read If You're New to The Genre;Caitlin Whetten;1556586235

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;RIQQRG60EY7NR;5;-- THE STORY --The story follows Anna Fox, an agoraphobic child psychologist who is holed up in her home, unable to leave the house for the past ten months.  Separated from her husband and daughter, she passes the days drinking too much wine, taking too many pills, chatting online with other people living with Agoraphobia and watching old black & white movies. She also has developed the bad habit of spying on her neighbors, using her Nikon camera’s zoom lens.She becomes especially intrigued by the Russell family — Jane, Alister and their teenage son Ethan — who recently moved in across the street. Much like the characters in a Hitchcock film, Anna becomes obsessed with her new neighbors until one night while spying at the Russell’s window, Anna sees something she shouldn’t have.  Or did she?From this point forward, Anna’s world quickly crumbles around her as we learn that nothing is as it seems. Now she has to convince everyone around her that though she was heavily medicated and drunk, what she saw was real and not a hallucination.-- WHAT I LIKED --I listened to this on audiobook, and as the story unfolded, I felt as though I were listening to a Hitchcockian thriller with a modern twist.  There seems to be a strong Hitchcock film influence here, and the entire story felt quite cinematic to me.  In fact, the plot line did make me think of Rear Window.  The story unraveled slowly (much like poor Anna’s supposedly safe world) and the numerous twists, turns, and direction changes all added to the story’s element of suspense. I also especially enjoyed the countless old movie references peppered throughout the story.I found Anna to be a simply enchanting protagonist.  The detailed depiction of her struggle with Agoraphobia was compelling and mesmerizing, and because of this, the book was unputdownable for me.  The story was told in a diary style from Anna’s first-person point of view, and I found the peek into her mind fascinating, especially once she began to doubt her own sanity.Because of the drinking and drugs, we come to realize that Anna is an unreliable narrator, making the story even all the more compelling when we’re not entirely sure that what she sees or believes is real.  Not only is she an unreliable narrator, but police also consider her an unreliable witness.  She is such a complex character, one moment clear and sure of herself, while other moments muddled and dreamlike. Though we’re not sure whether to trust her — especially given that she appears to be a compulsive liar —  Anna’s character is likable, sympathetic and for many of us, relatable (I mean who doesn’t drink wine and spy on their neighbors?) So though she’s flawed, she’s also incredibly complex.I found the intrigue surrounding her family especially fascinating.  Though Anna has regular phone conversations with her husband and eight-year-old daughter, the reader doesn’t know why they are separated.  We do know that some horrible — possibly tragic — event occurred to cause Anna’s Agoraphobia, causing us to suspect that this same event was responsible for Anna’s estrangement from her family.  As Anna’s story unfolds, flashbacks slowly reveal bits and pieces of what brought Anna to the point in her life where she’s a drunken, pill-popping recluse, unable to leave her house.The secondary character development was phenomenal as well.  Though we suspect that Anna is delusional and an unreliable narrator, we're not quite sure because most of the other characters in the book are kind of creepy or otherwise off-putting.  So we definitely have a case of not knowing who we can trust.What I especially liked is that I did not guess the ending.  Just when I thought I had the story all figured out, the author went and changed the entire storyline, and I found myself on an entirely different path.  I also could see no plot holes or inconsistencies in this story — everything made perfect sense to me, and I felt it was brilliantly plotted.-- WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE --I enjoyed the second part of the book much more than the first, probably because of the pacing. The first part was more on the slower to moderately paced side as it set the scene for the faster-paced more intense second half.  Though it didn’t exactly drag  -- because the characters became more developed and intriguing as the story progressed -- it also didn’t move as quickly as the second half.  There was also a fair amount of repetition in the first half which became more and more evident as the novel progressed.We learn as the story unfolds that Anna did something “big” to cause her separation from her family.  When we finally learn what that was, it just didn’t feel right to me.  It felt out of character for the person we’ve come to know throughout the story.  So because of this, I think a little more buildup and backstory would have been helpful, perhaps explaining why Anna did what she did.  As it stood, it just didn’t feel like something her character would do.-- FINAL VERDICT --This is a strong, character-driven suspenseful story that I found engrossing and suspenseful, especially once the pace picked up during the second half of the book.  The prose was lush and beautifully written, and because of that, this superb tale was a treat to read — or should I say listen to. I’m so glad that I listened to this in audiobook format as Anne Marie Lee is one hell of a narrator!The Woman in the Window was a highly emotional and truly captivating tale that I didn’t want to end.  It was a rich, riveting and intoxicating novel with gorgeous tension-filled scenes that sucked me right in.I’d recommend this novel to anyone who loves suspense, psychological thrillers, old movies and tales with a little darker twist to them and I ended up giving it 5 stars.This review originally posted on my blog at rogerhyttinen.com;What a thrill ride!;Roger Hyttinen;1556588275

62678426;The Woman in the Window: A Novel;R16P838V5N732J;4;I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller.  I found the main character Anna and her situation very interesting.  I was immediately drawn into the story and wanted to know where it was going.  The book took its time developing the characters and atmosphere before Anna witnessed the 'event' and by that time I really had no clue what was going on!  I figured out the one twist relatively early but it did not distract from the story - if anything it made me understand more.  I usually can guess endings but I did not guess this one until a few pages before it was revealed.  I thought the final twist/reveal might have been something more random but I was wrong.  Though again, it did not distract from my enjoyment of the story.  I listened to the book on Audible and while I did like the narrator and her performance, it was a bit slow so I speed up the speed to 1.5 for the last 1/4 of the book. I was also anxious to find out what happens!  Overall, I highly recommend this book.

I had small sprouts so I just cut them in quarters rather than shredding my knuckles too (next time I will buy pre-shredded sprouts). I also made the Baked accordion potatoes with paprika and thyme, which is how I think I will be eating all my baked potatoes from now on. YUM. To get some darker greens I tried the Charred broccolini with smoked paprika and pepitas. Loved the sprinkle of ricotta cheese in that one. One question ... do I have to wait until next winter to find Delicata squash? The photo of the Delicata with crispy sage is making me hungry again! I love that these were all very easy for me to throw together. No fuss. I didn’t stop to take pictures of my results (never do) so I am including snapshots from the cookbook of the three sides I’ve made so far. I admit that my accordion cuts were not as perfect as those in the photo, but I would still happily serve mine to company.;Checkout the Sides!;BB;1557383628

62824619;Cemetery Road: A Novel;R3SALKY25M5FBT;1;My thanks to all the reviewers. I have been a dedicated Iles fan for years. I adore his early books and read them over and over.Sadly, I had started noticing with the most recent trilogy that his writing was beginning to be very bloated. Additionally, Greg was falling victim to feeling his role is to be a moral authority. I miss the old days when his books were an intelligent escape. I loved reading them and saying to myself “Didn’t see THAT coming.”  Now they are increasingly preachy and drawn out.After reading the reviews, I plan on saving my time and money on this one.  While the addition of politics into this book may have been an attempt to keep it timely and relevant, it really makes it dated. Many Iles fans reread his books over and over years after they have been written. Not sure the politics of this time will hold up as a good read in 10 years.Please, Greg, bring back the timeless. totally engrossing thrillers with unexpected plot twists we used to know.  I’ll gladly pay for entertainment and escape, not politics.  I hope the next one is better. Fingers crossed.;Thanks for saving me money. I’ll skip this one.;Lori Johnson;1556849065

Mr. Isles, you are better than this, and you disappointed us with Cemetery Road.  I am going back to your older books, which are far superior to your latest endeavor.

62877577;Mostly Sunny: How I Learned to Keep Smiling Through the Rainiest Days;R3HLA13XQIPYYM;5;This is one of the best human interest books that I have read in years. I have watched Janice Dean on Fox for as long as she has been there. The way she told her life story put me into many of her scenes with joy and sorrow in my heart. I never felt sympathy for her but I did feel empathy. I have held my precious sister-in-laws hands and prayed with her when she was in so much pain & weary with MS. Janice, if you read this my love, I pray for you and your lovely family daily. You are a bowl of sunshine, even when it’s raining. Can’t wait until you write the adult book.;Excellent Read;Kindle Customer;1557259102

It is important to understand that celebrity lives are not always about glamour & wealth. Sometimes life has adversities, and you deal with them as Janice Dean has been doing. This is an especially good read for young people to realize that fame and fortune are not just handed to you—you work toward it. You have good days and bad days in life, and you give it your best. This is Janice Dean—giving her best.  Taking her experiences to help others.;Inspirational;in the Colorado rockies;1557287256

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;RANC7CBQ9PL9G;5;"This is an erudite story told by a Russian Count, Alexander Rostov, who three years after the 1817 October Revolution is suspected of being sympathetic to the former aristocracy and sentenced to house arrest at the Metropol hotel in Moscow. While his imposed lodging is a small attic room instead of his former grand suite there, he is still treated like royalty by the staff.At the Metropol the Count encounters an intelligent and spunky nine year old girl, Nina, who leads the Count through various obscure passages of the hotel and, together, they snoop on meetings of the Bolsheviks. But the Count remains unwaveringly apolitical until sometime later when he begins to wonder about the damage to his society occurring under the new Soviet State’s mandates.Finally in this time period Anna, a mysterious, successful actress, bids the Count to have sex but afterwards, curiously, is infuriated with him for his performing a trivial act of chivalry.A few years later the Soviet oppression under Stalin becomes more onerous. Anna falls from grace because Stalin dislikes a scene in one of her movies but makes a comeback by pleasing the Party with more Proletarian clips; and she repeats her bidding to the Count, this time launching a more enduring affair. The Count, now waiting on tables at the Metropol, is asked by an officer of the Party to teach him the language and ways of the English, French, and later, Americans.All these events in the first half of the book are followed-up by even more surprising and engrossing developments in the second half, some of them quite endearing, some treacherous. But I will truncate my review here with this introduction so as not to spoil them for you. Let me just add that, throughout this very exceptional book, the Count’s actions are replete with subtle humor which becomes hilarious at times, despite his serious predicaments.Martin Fricke, Ph.D. San Diego";A Book That Merits Its Inclusion in Classic Works of Fiction;D.P.

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;R1MS5HA35ZKQED;5;"While this is not a great Russian or English novel, I give it five stars because it is the best modern novel I've read in a long time. I was carried along by the author's insights and wit. The book starts out like sitting on a bench, eventually gets to a slow stroll and ends in a run to the finish. Following the plot is not terribly exciting until some characters are developed, but the trip through the book is made pleasurable by humor, philosophy, sophistication and great cleverness. I've been to Moscow, which helped, but it is still a pleasure to read as long as one is patient with the wordiness which gets better as one goes along. A bit of familiarity with Russian literature and history is not necessary, but helps. Before reading, one should watch the movie \Casablanca\"" if one has not.

It is something that needs to be savored and digested and considered. The book is thoroughly littered with wisdom and philosophical meanderings...some pertinent to the plot, some pertinent to time and place, and some simply like the kernels of wisdom that arise in daily life.The characters are full, with flaws and complexity. Those who are bit players, are suddenly important...and again, sometimes to the plot, sometimes to the psyche, and sometimes just because that's how life works out.In many ways the book gives the sense that you have met someone, they start to tell you a story...and keep telling.The narrator is a storyteller...it is a perfectly charming book of philosophy.";"A masterful epic story - this is not \history\""...it is storytelling...at its best!""";D.P.

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;R2N19QOBIECX1D;5;"This is an erudite story told by a Russian Count, Alexander Rostov, who three years after the 1817 October Revolution is suspected of being sympathetic to the former aristocracy and sentenced to house arrest at the Metropol hotel in Moscow. While his imposed lodging is a small attic room instead of his former grand suite there, he is still treated like royalty by the staff.At the Metropol the Count encounters an intelligent and spunky nine year old girl, Nina, who leads the Count through various obscure passages of the hotel and, together, they snoop on meetings of the Bolsheviks. But the Count remains unwaveringly apolitical until sometime later when he begins to wonder about the damage to his society occurring under the new Soviet State’s mandates.Finally in this time period Anna, a mysterious, successful actress, bids the Count to have sex but afterwards, curiously, is infuriated with him for his performing a trivial act of chivalry.A few years later the Soviet oppression under Stalin becomes more onerous. Anna falls from grace because Stalin dislikes a scene in one of her movies but makes a comeback by pleasing the Party with more Proletarian clips; and she repeats her bidding to the Count, this time launching a more enduring affair. The Count, now waiting on tables at the Metropol, is asked by an officer of the Party to teach him the language and ways of the English, French, and later, Americans.All these events in the first half of the book are followed-up by even more surprising and engrossing developments in the second half, some of them quite endearing, some treacherous. But I will truncate my review here with this introduction so as not to spoil them for you. Let me just add that, throughout this very exceptional book, the Count’s actions are replete with subtle humor which becomes hilarious at times, despite his serious predicaments.Martin Fricke, Ph.D. San Diego";A Book That Merits Its Inclusion in Classic Works of Fiction;D.P.

There are some reviewers that proclaim the absurdity of the concept. Perhaps so. Regardless, it is not something that you will read in one sitting because the writing is dense. You will read a paragraph and need to stop and think...then read 50 pages. The writing is elegant, eloquent, and breath-taking in its meaningfulness. It is something that needs to be savored and digested and considered. The book is thoroughly littered with wisdom and philosophical meanderings...some pertinent to the plot, some pertinent to time and place, and some simply like the kernels of wisdom that arise in daily life.The characters are full, with flaws and complexity. Those who are bit players, are suddenly important...and again, sometimes to the plot, sometimes to the psyche, and sometimes just because that's how life works out.In many ways the book gives the sense that you have met someone, they start to tell you a story...and keep telling.The narrator is a storyteller...it is a perfectly charming book of philosophy.";"A masterful epic story - this is not \history\""...it is storytelling...at its best!""";D.P.

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;RRBCJJK64E6WN;5;I became instantly immersed in this beautifully written historical novel and deeply involved in the Russian soul of Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov.  The book is a microcosm of the Soviet Union from 1922 through 1954.  Within the Hotel Metropol we experience the conversion of Russia and it's historical customs to a communist country.  This is an interesting way to record  history, especially a momentous experiment  such as the Soviet Union, and to describe the manner in which lives and expectations are changed as it develops over 32 years.  The beautiful, literary prose effected me deeply and I began to fee in my soull Count Rostov's love for the people, sensibilities, and long lost customs as they disappeared in Soviet society but remained in the memories and the souls of those who lived and worked in the Metropol.

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;R3C17Z0J7S01UM;5;"This is an erudite story told by a Russian Count, Alexander Rostov, who three years after the 1817 October Revolution is suspected of being sympathetic to the former aristocracy and sentenced to house arrest at the Metropol hotel in Moscow. While his imposed lodging is a small attic room instead of his former grand suite there, he is still treated like royalty by the staff.At the Metropol the Count encounters an intelligent and spunky nine year old girl, Nina, who leads the Count through various obscure passages of the hotel and, together, they snoop on meetings of the Bolsheviks. But the Count remains unwaveringly apolitical until sometime later when he begins to wonder about the damage to his society occurring under the new Soviet State’s mandates.Finally in this time period Anna, a mysterious, successful actress, bids the Count to have sex but afterwards, curiously, is infuriated with him for his performing a trivial act of chivalry.A few years later the Soviet oppression under Stalin becomes more onerous. Anna falls from grace because Stalin dislikes a scene in one of her movies but makes a comeback by pleasing the Party with more Proletarian clips; and she repeats her bidding to the Count, this time launching a more enduring affair. The Count, now waiting on tables at the Metropol, is asked by an officer of the Party to teach him the language and ways of the English, French, and later, Americans.All these events in the first half of the book are followed-up by even more surprising and engrossing developments in the second half, some of them quite endearing, some treacherous. But I will truncate my review here with this introduction so as not to spoil them for you. Let me just add that, throughout this very exceptional book, the Count’s actions are replete with subtle humor which becomes hilarious at times, despite his serious predicaments.Martin Fricke, Ph.D. San Diego";A Book That Merits Its Inclusion in Classic Works of Fiction;D.P.

143110438;A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel;RFUFGV7WWR3YC;5;"This is a beautifully written book.  The author has obviously studied closely the physical characteristics of one of the world's most elegant hotels (the Metropol) and the history of pre- and post-revolutionary Russia and he recreates the \feel\"" of an era, and a particular place, with extraordinary sensitivity and insight.  (The book was all the more enjoyable for me, since I spent quite a lot of time at the Metropol over a period of years in its new incarnation, but same glorious old building.)  The principal character, Count Alexander Rostov, is an idealized version of the best in the old aristocracy with its codes of honor, gentility and taste.  He becomes a \""Former Person\"" (itself,  a wonderfully ironic term applied to surviving aristocrats after the Revolution) and finds himself sentenced to a kind of permanent house arrest in the Metropol, where in easier days he had a large suite.  Now he is confined to a garret, but this does not prevent him from having an interesting life, building close relationships with hotel staff who respect his pedigree but accept him as a close friend, and with two very talented and adventurous young girls.  There are many twists to the plot, some extensive quotations from the golden age of Russian literature, and much serious thought about the quality of life under strained circumstances.  This is the best contemporary novel I have read in some time.

Intelligent, witty and absolutely delightful. Towles writes in such a manner that one immediately bonds with his characters, and in this book there are several. Count Rostov is a man we'd all like to know and the Metropol is more than just a hotel, it too, becomes a character that charms the reader. The book brings to life the thirty years Rostov is exiled in the hotel, and Towles makes you wish you could spend every day of those years along with Rostov.  None of the characters are filler, they each serve a purpose, even if that purpose isn't immediately evident. There are many little plots within the book that make one want to keep reading if only to discover what the next one will be.

Love Faithfully.;R1CAROR8O0Q0Z3;5;"As a long time fan of Little People, Big World, I was very excited when I heard that Jeremy and Audrey had written a book, so needless to say when I was given the opportunity to request this book to review I jumped at the chance. And I am SO glad I did, this book is fantastic! I really liked that it is a memoir, I'm not a big non-fiction reader but memoirs seem to always resonate the best with me, and I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this book! It was so cool to read Jer and Auj's love story, they are such an inspiration to me and their heart for Christ shines through in every word they write. As a single twenty something who made a commitment as a teenager to wait for the man God has for me this book was such an encouragement and inspiration to me, there were tons of great nuggets of wisdom in this book that I plan to put to use in my future relationship! I don't know how they did it, but Jeremy and Audrey somehow managed to craft a book that applies to all, no matter your current relationship status! I seriously loved this book, it's going on my keeper shelf and I definitely anticipate rereading it many times in the future! Highly recommended!A big thank you to the publisher for sending me a copy of this wonderful book!

316341789;Shoot for the Moon: The Space Race and the Extraordinary Voyage of Apollo 11;R3RT3DC3BO4WTM;5;The Apollo program was vast and complicated, yet this absorbing narrative gets to the heart of the story and makes it human. James Donovan’s focus is on the men and women who gave their all to the mission, whether it be the countless technicians or the famous astronauts themselves. His writing is infused with energy and purpose—he has a great eye for detail and atmosphere, and the narrative never gets bogged down by the enormity of the mission. Every reader knows how this ends, but it takes a special author to make it suspenseful and interesting nonetheless. A spectacular read.;An impressive book.;B. M. Howard;1557219930
316416266;Topgun: An American Story;R128OHM6ZUHYH4;4;I thank Captain Pedersen, USN Ret, for his service and for the gift that is his story. Topgun is written quite conversationally, and I appreciated that writing style while reading the more technical sections.  Who better to share the story of the creation of Topgun, than a man who lived and breathed it.  This book is definitely a combination of genres, memoir and history, with a sprinkling of social commentary and institutional criticism. I think that the addition of the back story of Dan Pedersen's personal and professional life (outside the Topgun years) laid the foundation for an interesting book.  I appreciated his willingness to refrain from sugar coating the aspects of the career he chose, especially the effect it had on his family. I would recommend this book on many levels, for the aviation buff, for the history, for the story, and for the experience.I received my copy through NetGalley and am under no obligation to the publisher.;Combination Memoir and Aviation History;Janet;1557328638

385521316;Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland;R1KJL01JZMC7U0;5;This non-fiction account of specific lives during The Toubles in Northern Ireland is thoroughly researched and developed, and very well-written. I applaud Radden Keefe's persistence over four years of study, research, and interviews to give us a compelling story of Jean McConville and her family, as well as other major players of the time--Gerry Adams, Delours Price, Brendan Hughes.The IRA and its members often had a romantic and heroic place in the media, people who were willing to go to extreme lengths in the name of religious and cultural freedom. But those years happened well before 9/11 when terroristic violence, unfortunately, became a common crime. Reading Say Nothing perhaps exposed some of my own religious and cultural bias (I am an Irish Catholic), and forced me to see all the sides--the British, the Loyalists, the IRA--in a more objective light.If I have any critique at all of the book, I would say that I wished it had moved a bit faster. I sometimes found myself having to refer to my mental roster to recall who was who, particularly as the time periods shifter frequently.;Thorough and Enlightening;Christina;1557140395
385521316;Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland;R1ADH1O2Z5V1EO;5;"As one Amazon reviewer notes, this is NOT the book to read if you want to learn about the history of The Troubles by examining the Loyalist experience and Loyalist crimes as well as the challenging history of the IRA and Gerry Adams.  This book is not focused on providing the stories of 'both sides.'  But in terms of examining the impact of violence perpetrated by the IRA — not just on victims but on those who committed murders, hid them away, denied them, and suffered PTSD for many years thereafter — this is narrative non-fiction of the highest order.  This is a book that makes me want to read more.  For those who only wanted the story of the single murder that is a focus in the title and early and later chapters, the book may seem long and digressive.  But I loved all of it, particularly the way it was structured.  The story about Jean McConville, a widow and mother of ten who was \disappeared\"" by neighbors, is powerful and unforgettable, but it's the kind of story that needs the full context Keefe provides to make perfect sense.  He provides that context by telling many other stories about the people who joined the IRA, the orphaned children, and about what happened, over time, to all these people who were psychologically scarred by the requirement to 'say nothing.'  This is a story about a culture at war with itself that built a fragile peace on denial.  The book makes sense structurally because it moves forward chronologically — and then leans back into time as necessary.Although I don't tend to read that much history — but focus largely on fiction, memoir, poetry, and some biography — this is the kind of book that is leading me to want to read more narrative non-fiction of this caliber — as well as connecting to other works I've read, seen, or listened to recently:  Seamus Heany's poems, Anna Burns' \""Milkman,\""  and Jez Butterworth's marvelous 'The Ferryman,' which I saw on Broadway a week ago.Finally, I read this book in whispersync.  The X-Ray feature in Kindle is helpful in placing and revisiting the many characters and includes many terrific photographs. And the Audible version, narrated by Matthew Blaney who sounds Irish, is a fine listen — though it does seem slightly odd that the American author doesn't have an American narrator.  Perhaps that was a wise choice, though, as listening to Blaney's voice was an absolute treat that made me feel as if I, too, were visiting Ireland, hearing the stories as they ought to be heard.""";Superb narrative non-fiction that deserves all the stellar reviews;Susan D;1557326926

What the cookbook is not: Solely and simply a cookbook. Who this book is best suited for: The curious and advanced home cook, the lover of peppers, or the master gardener. (Bonus for all three!) Three words to sum it up: Comprehensive, educational, and stunning.The Review: Peppers of the Americas Large part history book, large part botanical text book, and small part cookbook, Maricel E. Presilla’s Peppers of the Americas: The Remarkable Capsicums that Forever Changed Flavor delves into the diverse life and, well, remarkable journey of the not-so-lonely pepper. The Capsicum aficionado, chef, and food writer delves into her subject and presents it beautifully.I found myself genuinely intrigued by Presilla’s vast knowledge and writing style, and the content is about as expansive as the numerous pepper varieties highlighted in the book. When you read, you’ll learn about the history of peppers and how they migrated into the landscape and eventually the cuisines of cultures from all over the world. You’ll learn about the numerous varieties of peppers, how they’re grown, their flavor and heat profiles, and how best to use them.  You’ll learn how peppers have painted flavorful strokes in American cuisine—and how Sriracha and Tabasco are just scratching the surface when it comes to application possibilities.I was especially intrigued by the illustrations by Julio Figueroa and photographs by Romulo Yanes. The illustrations of flowering capsicum branches and budding peppers reminded me of vintage botanical prints. I resisted ripping out the pages and hanging them in my kitchen.The recipes, though sparse, are just as interesting. Instruction includes pepper growing, handling, drying, fermenting, and pickling. Presilla also guides us though making chili salts, pastes, and powders and applying these products to infuse recipes like Fresh Fruit with Guatemalan Chile Cobán and Cacao Condiment, Grilled Japanese Spring Onions with Romesco, and Galician-Style Octopus with Paprika and Olive Oil.Some might find the book intimidating or better suited for a coffee table than for the kitchen. I, personally, didn’t find the discipline to read the entire book, cover to cover, because of its fairly dense writing.

I don't bake a ton, so I don't have an extensive baking pan selection, so these notes made it a lot easier. The book has a lot of advice to make baking cakes less intimidating. Simple and clean flavors but done really well throughout this book. The book is a great reference for anyone who wants to work on their baking skills and frosting skills.I made the chocolately chocolate cake and it was a huge hit among coworkers! I can't wait to try others from this book.The book itself isn't super heavy, the pages are a great quality and the pictures are beautiful.  Pages won't easily tear and the cover is sturdy.

451490800;The Kiss Quotient;R3COPVIXUV3BXH;5;"When I picked up this book, it was pretty much well-liked everywhere, and I must say - it lived up to its hype. The book was so good I pretty much read it in one sitting; I think I read the first half non-stop and then came up for some air and water. In a fake dating trope scenario, Stella asks Michael to be her sex and dating coach, but they soon fall in love with each other. The main obstacles are their respective insecurities - hers being that she is autistic, and his about his sex work and the fact that she is rich and successful and he is not. The book develops their relationship so well, from their compatible companionship and understanding to their sizzling hot relationship in bed.Stella is an amazing protagonist - kind, and emotional, logical and pragmatic, but also awkward with people. She tries hard to fit in with allistic people and her character development is to do with acknowledging that she doesn't have to fix herself for that. Michael is also so adorable and sexy - he is gentle and empathetic, and has respect for women; he has problems with possessiveness, though. Michael's character development, however, is more extrinsic in that he finally can breathe when his problems are resolved, and intrinsically, it is more about having the self-confidence to not get intimidated by her success, or feel like he has nothing to offer her. They take so long to acknowledge their feelings for each other, its like a 'just admit it already gawd!' kind of tension. Oh, and there are some super hot sex scenes in this one, so you are warned if you are about to read this book in public *wink*For a person who is not a fan of romance-centered novels, I sure loved this book a lot and that's the best way of me saying - go read it! Also, I can't wait to read the next one, The Bride Test, with Khai (Michael's cousin) as the main character.";sexy and adorable romance;MrsLeif;1556584824

The narrative often glosses over—and even idealizes—the many misdeeds of the young Noah and his friends. While this witty approach may be welcomed on his TV appearances, it does not seem appropriate for the fifth and sixth graders the publishers say they are targeting.

525619372;Master & Apprentice (Star Wars);R2ITQ8GVRKD5PV;5;"Star Wars: Master and Apprentice is a 2019 novel by Claudia Gray. It is part of the new canon, and is set prior to The Phantom Menace, the first book in the new canon set during this time period.As its cover and title imply, Master and Apprentice focuses heavily on the relationship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. After an old friend and fellow Jedi Knight requests assistance with a political dispute, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are off to the planet of Pijal to assist however they can. When master and apprentice arrive, they find the delicate situation is more complicated and disturbing than either had been led to believe. In addition, Qui-Gon Jinn begins to experience cryptic visions that bespeak future violence, visions that Obi-Wan is skeptical of. As Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan navigate the deceitful and dangerous web of Pijal's royal court, their relationship is strained like never before. Will master and apprentice be able to unravel the mystery while maintaining the integrity of the their relationship?Master and Apprentice brings to mind such classic pre-Phantom Menace novels as Cloak of Deception or Darth Plagueis, and it is a worthy addition to these other novels. Qui-Gon Jinn (and Count Dooku, for that matter) were criminally under-explored in the films, so I am most excited to see more light shed on these characters. And what a great job Claudia Gray does of it! Characterization is certainly the highlight of the book. The dynamic relationship Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is rendered beautifully, as are their individual characters. Gray nails the characters in terms of how they think, act, and speak, and it is a real pleasure to spend time with these folks and get to know them better. There are also some dynamite flashback sequences involving Count Dooku and Qui-Gon that help develop both characters in interesting ways.Beyond characterization, the story is also quite good. It moves at a good clip, and has enough twists and turns to keep you interested. The world-building and creation of the unique culture on Pijal is a testament to the author's strong ability to write effective science fiction, and not just a good Star Wars story. The author also dives into the lore of the Jedi, giving the novel a real depth. The quality of writing is high, and I am so glad the author didn't write the novel with the childish tone found in many of the new canon novels.Though excellent, I did find a couple of things in Master and Apprentice that did not thrill me. Firstly, I don't know that Pax and Rahara were needed in the story. Claudia Gray builds them into good characters, but in the end they just serve to take away from other characters we would rather spend more time with. Secondly, I was rather surprised by the amount of cursing in the novel. Though mild, I don't believe it was necessary. The very mild sexual innuendos were also a little surprising. Other than these, my complaints were few.Master and Apprentice should not be missed. It is among the best Star Wars novels I have read, both in new and old canons. It is very encouraging to see that great science fiction still comes out under the Star Wars label, and I sincerely hope the trend continues.";Amongst the Best in SW Fiction;fanboy3712;1557253836

525619372;Master & Apprentice (Star Wars);R3TNLG1Y4BMVDW;5;"Claudia Gray’s “Master and Apprentice” begins with the troubled apprenticeship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan struggles to adapt to Qui-Gon’s unique interpretation of Jedi rules and his unorthodox approach to problems. Qui-Gon can see the bright future his apprentice will have, but doesn’t feel that he’s the best teacher. When the Jedi Council offers Qui-Gon a position on the council, the possibility that Qui-Gon will transfer Obi-Wan to another master for training so he may accept the offer further strains their partnership. Before Qui-Gon can make a decision, however, the two must travel to Pijal, where the reclusive government is about to undergo sweeping changes as the Czerka Corporation opens a hyperspace corridor nearby. Since the princess is only 14, the Jedi Rael Averross has been acting as the regent due to his neutrality for the last eight years following the tragic death of his padawan. Recent terrorist attacks threaten the forthcoming change from an absolute to constitutional monarchy as well as the construction of infrastructure for the hyperspace corridor, so the Pijali government requests an investigation by the Jedi. Averross apprenticed with Count Dooku prior to Qui-Gon and personally vouches for him to lead the investigation.In exploring Qui-Gon’s unorthodox methods, Gray focuses on his fascination with Jedi prophecy. The discovery of a fool’s gold type of kyber crystal evokes one of these prophecies: “When the kyber that is not kyber shines forth, the time of prophecy will be at hand” (pg. 117). Other prophecies run through the novel, such as “she who was born to darkness will give birth to darkness” (pg. 229), possibly a reference to Leia and Ben Solo, as well as “he who learns to conquer death will through his greatest student live again” (pg. 288), which may refer to Emperor Palpatine’s forthcoming return in “Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.” Quoting one of Qui-Gon’s aphorisms, Obi-Wan says, “People are more than their worst act” (pg. 116), contributing to the belief in redemption that runs as a throughline in the “Star Wars” saga. The story further helps to explore themes from “The Phantom Menace” as the Czerka Corporation relies on slave labor, somehow skirting the laws of the Republic and establishing Qui-Gon’s feeling that the Jedi Council, in obeying its mandate of nonintervention, has allowed evil to flourish at the margins of society (pg. 212). Qui-Gon enlists the help of Rahara Wick, a formerly enslaved person turned jewel smuggler, to help him search for the Pijali Opposition unnoticed. Both Rahara’s experience and Czerka’s attempts to codify slavery as a punishment for most crimes on Pijal (pg. 188) help to show the corruption and moral lapses in the twilight of the Republic.Previous authors have examined Obi-Wan Kenobi’s apprenticeship with Qui-Gon Jinn, in particular Dave Wolverton and Jude Watson in the “Jedi Apprentice” series, though this is the first novel in the new “Star Wars” canon to examine the period prior to “Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.” In helping to link the prequel-era stories together, Gray not only includes the references to kyber crystals and Jedi prophecy, she also includes flashbacks to Qui-Gon’s apprenticeship with Dooku and shows Obi-Wan learning to ride a veractyl, one of the creatures he rode in “Revenge of the Sith” (pg. 151), and reflecting on the Guardians of the Whills in a reference to “Rogue One” (pg. 243). The idea of a Jedi acting as planetary regent as well as the characterization of Averross recalls some of the best elements of the 1990s Bantam “Star Wars” novels, like Corran Horn.

525619372;Master & Apprentice (Star Wars);R2BP87EDQFB9O9;5;"Claudia Gray’s “Master and Apprentice” begins with the troubled apprenticeship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan struggles to adapt to Qui-Gon’s unique interpretation of Jedi rules and his unorthodox approach to problems. Qui-Gon can see the bright future his apprentice will have, but doesn’t feel that he’s the best teacher. When the Jedi Council offers Qui-Gon a position on the council, the possibility that Qui-Gon will transfer Obi-Wan to another master for training so he may accept the offer further strains their partnership. Before Qui-Gon can make a decision, however, the two must travel to Pijal, where the reclusive government is about to undergo sweeping changes as the Czerka Corporation opens a hyperspace corridor nearby. Since the princess is only 14, the Jedi Rael Averross has been acting as the regent due to his neutrality for the last eight years following the tragic death of his padawan. Recent terrorist attacks threaten the forthcoming change from an absolute to constitutional monarchy as well as the construction of infrastructure for the hyperspace corridor, so the Pijali government requests an investigation by the Jedi. Averross apprenticed with Count Dooku prior to Qui-Gon and personally vouches for him to lead the investigation.In exploring Qui-Gon’s unorthodox methods, Gray focuses on his fascination with Jedi prophecy. The discovery of a fool’s gold type of kyber crystal evokes one of these prophecies: “When the kyber that is not kyber shines forth, the time of prophecy will be at hand” (pg. 117). Other prophecies run through the novel, such as “she who was born to darkness will give birth to darkness” (pg. 229), possibly a reference to Leia and Ben Solo, as well as “he who learns to conquer death will through his greatest student live again” (pg. 288), which may refer to Emperor Palpatine’s forthcoming return in “Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.” Quoting one of Qui-Gon’s aphorisms, Obi-Wan says, “People are more than their worst act” (pg. 116), contributing to the belief in redemption that runs as a throughline in the “Star Wars” saga. The story further helps to explore themes from “The Phantom Menace” as the Czerka Corporation relies on slave labor, somehow skirting the laws of the Republic and establishing Qui-Gon’s feeling that the Jedi Council, in obeying its mandate of nonintervention, has allowed evil to flourish at the margins of society (pg. 212). Qui-Gon enlists the help of Rahara Wick, a formerly enslaved person turned jewel smuggler, to help him search for the Pijali Opposition unnoticed. Both Rahara’s experience and Czerka’s attempts to codify slavery as a punishment for most crimes on Pijal (pg. 188) help to show the corruption and moral lapses in the twilight of the Republic.Previous authors have examined Obi-Wan Kenobi’s apprenticeship with Qui-Gon Jinn, in particular Dave Wolverton and Jude Watson in the “Jedi Apprentice” series, though this is the first novel in the new “Star Wars” canon to examine the period prior to “Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.” In helping to link the prequel-era stories together, Gray not only includes the references to kyber crystals and Jedi prophecy, she also includes flashbacks to Qui-Gon’s apprenticeship with Dooku and shows Obi-Wan learning to ride a veractyl, one of the creatures he rode in “Revenge of the Sith” (pg. 151), and reflecting on the Guardians of the Whills in a reference to “Rogue One” (pg. 243). The idea of a Jedi acting as planetary regent as well as the characterization of Averross recalls some of the best elements of the 1990s Bantam “Star Wars” novels, like Corran Horn. Gray previous wrote three of the best character studies in the new “Star Wars” canon – “Lost Stars,” “Bloodline,” and “Leia: Princess of Alderaan” – and this is more of the style fans expect of her.

Even the one chapter focused on his alleged romance with Trumpism reads like a put-up job, designed to elicit sympathy from the reader, without adding a shred of insight into the LA nuts and flakes he antagonizes with the charade.

670012106;SHOUT;R2BJ9L73FLJNW8;5;"I often wondered how Laurie could write such raw, emotional and spot on books. After reading Shout I understood how her writing has evolved. The authentic voice in each book came out of her own pain and experiences. Shout is one of those books that reaches inside of you and grabs your guts and twists them. It is painful yet for some of us it is also a release. You know that someone has grabbed hold of your guts to help untangle them. That  is what this book does. I met Laurie years ago at an English conference. I stood in line with her book \Speak\"" to get it signed. I handed it to her but would not look at her. She held on to the book as she handed it back forcing me to look up at her. Then she said, \""You're Melinda.\"" My lip quivered as tears slid down my face. She hugged me and and for the first time I felt the strength to do something.  Laurie never knew how she helped me.  My abuser was a family member.  My meeting with her gave me the courage to put myself into counseling. The next time I saw that family member I pulled them aside.  They had long ago sought counseling for the incident. At the time I felt so dirty and ashamed that I didn't want anyone to know. and I didn't want anyone to talk to me about it. My mantra was, \""God forgave them so it's done and over with.\"" For me it wasn't. On that day I walked up to them and told them. \""God forgave you and so have I, but I haven't dealt with it. I'm doing that right now. Understand there will days that I hate you as I go through this process. There are days you can't talk to me or hug me or anything else. I hope you will respect that.\""  They sidestepped and said they would do whatever to help me heal.\"" That was not what I expected. Healing is a long process. If you read Laurie's book you will understand it. We all have to find our path and our voice.Laurie's book is raw. It takes you through her painful life. It takes you through the events that led up to her getting her voice back. I read and thought about the different people and events in my own life that paralleled hers. My family life unlike hers was not as volatile.  My parents were very strict Christians. This is one reason I suffered so long. As Christians we were told you  don't talk about certain things. You let things go and let God handle it.  I walked through each painful moment with her.  When she is accepted as an exchange student she became a new person. She was away from her old life and was given  the opportunity to see what a healthy life is like. She was given the strength to grow and become the person she is today. This event put her on the path to healing. It is never done and over but you gain the strength to move on.I know of no other author who's books have helped both students and adults as much as Laurie's books. I highly recommend her book \""Shout\"".  It explains so much about the other books.""";A Voice for the Voiceless;Sandra K. Stiles;1557368616

735218897;Metropolis (A Bernie Gunther Novel);RU02K2BXBGRCV;4;I wish I liked this novel more than I did. I have great respect for Philip Kerr and particularly his first three Bernie Gunther books, and it is because of that respect that I give it 4 stars rather than the 3 I think it rightly deserves.

Interesting and appealing characters, secrets neatly revealed in intriguing increments, many things very well done here. I like that there is really no 'villain' and a great moral dilemma. I only wonder whether the author was able to maintain control of her vision in writing this story.The problem - *spoiler alert* - is with the ending. I do not see the character who set the fire as being able to do so. Burning down a home, even if you think no one is inside it, is pretty major. It's not something someone does as a lark, or out of rebellion against one's family, at least not someone without any other criminal tendencies. It just isn't in the same league as getting drunk or graffiti as \teenager acting out'. And this teenager is not portrayed as being that violent, just as feeling alone, unloved, and not understood.";;;

Though it’s not the be-all cure-all, this book provides a much needed supplement: a definable and easy to personally adapt system. I was invited to be on Michael’s launch team for this book, but like the books I review, you’re getting my honest reflections.Hyatt offers three steps to help obtain a right focus: STOP, CUT, and ACT. Each broken down into three sub-steps of their own. The overall ambition is to help you prioritize, create efficiencies and then take action. Within each step and sub-step of Hyatt’s book, readers are provided with many easy to apply techniques, examples, and practical tools. As he says; “Your plan can’t be to allow everyone else to steer your day or you’ll never get anything done that matters to you. Design a day that works for your goals and priorities.”He treats readers to many premises, approaches, and tools. He does not say you must eliminate every possible distraction, spend a ton of money, and find a utopian state. Instead, you get a simple formula with a ton of potential.Will you be able to adapt it all into your life? Truthfully, some will not work for you and your lifestyle. That’s okay, though, because there are several suggestions you can experiment with and iterate for finding ways to work them into other parts of your life. It’s worked for me, and maybe it will for you, too.";Proven Tools and Lessons from the Expert;Chad Gramling;1556800783

812993268;The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life;RLOV0WEFNG85P;4;The Second Mountain is a book stuffed with anecdotes, quotes, aphorisms, and generalizations. While I don't doubt the sincerity of the author, I couldn't learn from what I read. It was too vague, somewhat directionless. If there are 500 ways to find your path or succeed or find happiness or serve humanity, and you want to write a book about all of it, you'll need to narrow the focus, because otherwise, it's just too much information. I couldn't find threads or draw conclusions. I wasn't compelled to take notes or record snippets of wisdom. Everything was good. It was all good. And therefore, nothing made much of an impression. Maybe it was just me. I read to page 150 and gave up.

I'd really like to get further into the book so I can play Trucks, as I've always wanted to daydream about being a heavy-metal rocker truck driver blaring down the shipping lanes with his pet dog named \Bonedog\"" to deliver pallets of tobacco and beef jerky to a grimy gas station in Nashville.  However, I keep getting stuck during the tutorial stage with the Shadow Self. After arriving at Sanctuary ( have to say doesn't look at all like the E3 trailer) the instructions very specifically states that the shadow IS NOT supposed to come inside with you. Unfortunately, no matter what I do the shadow stays connected to my feet and comes inside with me, even after restarting multiple times. Even after several minutes of protests and aggressive gesticulation, I cannot manage to get him to leave the building. He just sits there, as if mocking me in with its ghostly facsimile. At one point I thought I figured it out by standing at the doorway then shutting it quickly in an attempt to trap the shadow on one side and myself on the other, but as soon as the door closed he was back again immediately, although now he was on the door instead. I have begun the process of installing high-intensity halogen bulbs throughout Sanctuary in hopes that I can somehow complete the tutorial by just removing the Shadow Man entirely, although if this doesn't work I fear more drastic measures will need to be considered...

Upon arriving to 1836, I found myself held at gunpoint by a fellow time traveler. He explained that he had been sent back to turn the Alamo into a total, complete defeat, and burn it to the ground. This would break the spirit of the Texas resistance and secure the victory for Santa Ana and Mexico.He decided to let me live, telling me that there was no possible way I could interfere enough to prevent him from accomplishing his mission. As he rode away, I immediately started for the Alamo to warn Davy Crockett of the incoming attack.Long story short, I was able to \acquire\"" some experimental Colt model 1836 revolvers and train the defenders of the Alamo on how to use them.  When the attack came, my rival time traveler used his knowledge of the battle (since he's from the year 2038) and was able to breach the walls very quickly. But with our superior firepower we were able to hold them off just long enough for me to use a Kentucky rifle to kill my time-traveling nemesis. The Alamo still fell, and I died at the hands of  Santa Ana himself, but because of the fierce fight we gave the enemy, our actions inspired the entire state of Texas to fight back against the invaders.I had my doubts about this book.

998379417;Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself: Second Edition;R2LV2NXR021ELJ;5;I played Murder Night and my story was as follows. I had been murdering for a long time. But eventually I got the ok from an unknown supervisor that I could retire and go on to have a family and a normal life. I never wanted to murder, the only reason I had ever started was that some higher ups realized that i had a newborn daughter and decided to use her as leverage against me. They blackmailed me with her life. Just recently that same daughter had just given birth to her boy, my grandson. My life couldn’t be going better, but one day a man came up to me as I was drinking tea with my wife at the local coffee shop and slipped me a letter. I was told to do one last job, I shutter to think about the consequences of not following the order. Now here I am at this party with all of these people with innumerable enemies, and because I can’t find the envelope with my targets name I just have to guess. I come to deduce that Lord Bloodington, an infamous railroad tycoon and also our host, must be the one who sent me. I then, after learning more about my fellow party goers, realize that my target must be zephyr xanadu, who undoubtedly has blown up several railroad bridges, that were likely owned by our host. I suggest that we split up to look for clues, obviously suggesting that I and my target go alone to search the ballroom, I was met with some flack but xanadu agreed, assuring everyone that she could handle herself, this only made me more nervous. Once we get there, I try and think about how to go about this quietly. Then xanadu turns to me and informs me that she has reached all of the same conclusions I have about her being the target, and she knows that I am the killer. She jumps at me with a knife and puts me in a choke hold holding the knife to my throat, I break free but not before she slits open my left eye making me half blind. She jumps back as I try to recover. I fire a couple of rounds as she rushes toward me for another cut. I miss, she does not. I lose my right eye and am now completely blind. I try to orient myself in the room as she walks around me, taunting me. I realize where the chandelier is and I fire 3 shots in its direction, it falls to the ground and the room is pitch black (I assume) neither of us can see now. She laughs, telling me that I only have one round left, she’s right. She charges at me, I listen for the steps and draw my weapon and fire. A bang and then silence. I don’t really know what has happened. Did I get her? Everyone comes in the room, rushing our direction from the gunshots. They all look at me. I could swear I heard Helen Hayes crying, but who knows. They all know what happened, they know I did it. They’re all so relieved that they aren’t the target that they let me go, after all, they’re all probably murderers themselves. I’m led to my cab by our host. As I’m getting in he says,” great job, go home to your family. You won’t hear from us again.” When I get home, my wife comes out to get me, not realizing yet that I am blind. She sounds so happy. But once she realizes, and it sets in she just pulls me in for a hug and weeps.

Reading this report, I wonder how anyone can doubt that Trump is using the office to do whatever he wants. Most of the information in the report was already known to anyone who follows the news. It is easy to see that there are many great investigative reporters and what they found was not fake news. Mueller has verified it all in the report. It is amazing though to to realize just how much was done. The news cycle spins faster than a pinwheel in a hurricane since Trump took office. My main take away from the report is that Congress should begin impeachment hearings and then bring in all the players and have them testify in open hearings.

1119580501;The Official ACT Prep Guide 2019-2020, (Book + 5 Practice Tests + Bonus Online Content);R1RLQHO0HV3N73;4;"I'm a Harvard grad, ACT perfect scorer and professional tutor/coach since 2002.The Official ACT Prep Guide 2019-20 Edition is the essentially the exact same book as previous editions, such as the Official ACT Prep Guide 2018-19, the Official ACT Prep Guide 2018, and the Official ACT Prep Guide 2016-2017, other than the fact that it now includes a 5th paper test (the December 2017 ACT Form A10) and some minor updates/revisions. Yet this book continues to be the most essential preparation guide for the ACT, because it is the only source of official test questions—the practice ACTs in all other books are nothing more than subpar imitations of the real thing.Don’t bother downloading the Kindle edition, however. First of all, the proprietary Amazon Kindle e-reader file format is so highly “DRM”ed that it’s very difficult to transfer your Kindle file to a format that is easy for printing like PDF—and even if you are somehow able to do so, you will notice that the print quality is poor and the text is too blurry.Thus, you should only buy the Kindle edition if you plan to do all of your reading off a screen, such as an iPad or an actual Kindle—but even then I wouldn’t recommend it. The SAT is a still paper test—at least for now—and as such should be studied for/practiced on paper. At best, the Kindle version of the book should be an add-on to the paper version—something portable and practical to supplement your studies on paper while you are away on vacation and don't want to lug this book around, for example.Of course, these 5 official ACTs are just scratching the surface of what’s out there in terms of official ACT practice material: as of this writing I’ve counted 75 official ACTs that are publicly available online—including some of the tests in this book. Although additional learning and strategy guides are also helpful, as are classes, videos and tutoring, the best place to start your ACT studies is with official practice questions.Overall, this book is a must-have for nearly any ACT prep student who appreciates the convenience of having 5 tests already printed out and ready to go with (somewhat helpful) answer explanations. However, the College Board's SAT book includes 8 practice tests, which I feel is a more reasonable number, so the main reason why I'm taking away one star is that there should be more practice exams.For more information, you can google \ACT Action Plan - McElroy Tutoring\"" for my full, updated list of ACT Prep recommendations.";;;

I loved that, made it so much easier to follow along. The character development for the entire family Diana, Tom, Ollie, Lucy, Nettie and Patrick was done so very well. This is such an enlightening book with a great “who dun it” mystery at the core. It also really makes you think about how you perceive a person’s behavior without really knowing or even trying to understand the reasons why. The going back and forth from past and present gave the story a wonderful background and drops little tidbits that make you think you have it all figured out and then you get blindsided.

There aren’t a lot of private communal areas in our house so Ollie guides the police to the dining room and pulls out a couple of chairs. I follow, pushing my newly folded laundry into a basket. The piles collapse into each other like tumbling buildings. The police sit on the chairs, Ollie balances on the arm of the sofa, and I remain sharply upright, stiff. Bracing. “Firstly I need to confirm that you are relatives of Diana Goodwin—” “Yes,”Ollie says, “she’s my mother.” “Then I’m very sorry to inform you,” the policewoman starts, and I close my eyes because I already know what she is going to say.

However, Diana is a stern woman and doesn't have any qualms in speaking her mind even though it might hurt someones feelings. As we jump back and forth in time lines we discover that Diana is not the person that everyone things she is. She had to struggle and work hard to get financially stable and wealthy and felt that everyone needed to work hard to get what they wanted out of life. I was emotionally invested in every character wishing that if Diana would have communicated better with her children and loosen up a bit there would have been a better outcome.

A smile that pierces my heart, unpicks me a little. It’s not the neighbors, that smile says. This bad news is yours. There aren’t a lot of private communal areas in our house so Ollie guides the police to the dining room and pulls out a couple of chairs. I follow, pushing my newly folded laundry into a basket. The piles collapse into each other like tumbling buildings. The police sit on the chairs, Ollie balances on the arm of the sofa, and I remain sharply upright, stiff. Bracing. “Firstly I need to confirm that you are relatives of Diana Goodwin—” “Yes,”Ollie says, “she’s my mother.” “Then I’m very sorry to inform you,” the policewoman starts, and I close my eyes because I already know what she is going to say. My mother-in-law is dead.********* The Mother-in-law by Sally Hepworth is a compelling, fast paced, gripping novel that I read in one sitting!

I really enjoyed The Family Next Door so when I saw this as an option on NetGalley I jumped at the chance to review the ARC.I was definitely not disappointed. I really enjoy Ms. Hepworth's writing style. She is both conversational & modern, while giving detailed descriptions and not coming across like she is writing a blog or personal essay.The Mother-in-Law is told from various viewpoints and alternates between the timeline of \Past\"" and \""Present\"". The first narrator is Lucy (in the past), a young woman whose own mother passed away when she was a teenager of cancer. As she preps for her first dinner with her fiance, Ollie's family, Lucy waxes hopeful about meeting the woman who could fill the hole left in her life at the death of her own mother. The meeting goes poorly. Ollie's mother, Diana is a cold woman not prone to emotion nor giving any outward signs of her reactions. Lucy overhears her tell Ollie that she thinks Lucy is \""fine\""-setting the tone for what will be a difficult relationship.";;;

It explores the relationship between daughter-in-law and mother-in-law.The story is told from both points of view and is set both in the past and in the present with a small peak into the future at the end.Lucy lost her mother when she was young and is thrilled at the prospect of having a mother-in-law to love and admire. Diana is definitely an admirable woman; however, she is not a person who it is easy to relate to – that is, unless you happen to be a recipient of her charity for unwed mothers.The story unfolds and tells the tale of how their relationship developed and then the abrupt ending when Diana is found dead.

1250140269;The Malta Exchange: A Novel (Cotton Malone);R2R4XOKKU006H7;3;"I've tried several times to read Steve Berry as others read him; with pleasure. When I read the plot of his new novel, that had a dead Pope, a lost relic, the Knights of Malta, Mussolini, and Churchill; I had to give it another go.The novel grabbed my attention immediately and I was reading with pleasure until the author that fascism was being flushed out. Bretton Woods put corporate fascism on steroids! The reader can surmise my reluctance in reading material that owes its allegiance to an academic corporate complex. In history & archaeology the real stories are suppressed on multiple levels. All this prelude to say why this reader has difficulties reading mainstream novels; especially in regards to accepted academic histories.That said, I was reading this novel; not for its historical accuracy - but for the writing, characters, setting, and story.The pages flew by until; again, the typical mainstream hero starts closely resembling a super hero.I enjoyed the author's detailed history of the Knights of Malta. In my readings, for example; the Knights Templar were really the world's first military industrial-like complex. Of course, this story stayed within the parameters of accepted agreed upon fables.The Vatican spy network was always a belief I had, and this novel comes close to that aspect and the one I most enjoyed. The author obviously writes well, characterizes with the best of the mainstream competitors and is superb in his historical research. Still, I don't buy the official, nor even close to official history presented.I must admit, also a bias against that revered historical institution, The Smithsonian. I think they suppress and at best obfuscate certain histories they don't want to public knowing.So, although I wanted to read Berry without prejudice; I found it baked into the cake, and realized my many readings in alternative historical investigative writings; have bridged the mainstream storylines, by causing a total collapse in their suspension of the belief.A well researched novel with superb historical due diligence, best selling writing & characterization, and a believable plot line - with the aforementioned caveats.";A Well Researches Thriller Against a Superb Historical Backdrop - with a number of caveats>;R.

1250140269;The Malta Exchange: A Novel (Cotton Malone);R943I86KIDGLX;5;Many of my favorite authors write series – sometime a dozen books or more featuring a main character like Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels. Often it seems like the author burns out – after a while the books become formulaic, or, worse, they forget their roots and it seems like the author is just phoning it in. The last two Reacher novels were like that.Not so, Steve Berry and his protagonist, Cotton Malone. I have always enjoyed his books and this one is no exception. The writing is good, the locations are perfectly set and the story line is interesting with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. The interplay between Cotton’s travails are interposed with those of Luke Daniels an agent of the Magellan Billet – a group of agents defending the United States (Malone is retired from the job and helps out as a hired hand from time to time). Finally they team up and help stave off a disaster (no spoilers here). The action takes place mainly in Rome and Malta with some interesting historical mystery (much of it based on true facts) that really keeps you guessing.This is not heavy reading – it’s a great summer read, but it is very entertaining and I enjoyed reading it very much!;Anotehr great book by Steve Berry!;N.

1250185947;Kushner, Inc.: Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump;RD8PQ576TLNU6;4;"Definitely worth buying.What a great expose Ward has written;  it confirms all my worst fears that everyone who runs in trump’s orbit is rotten to the core.Not only are the core beliefs rotten, but the very manner in how any is tackled just stinks of corruption to the max.The best way to describe Kushner and Ivanka is that they are both nothing but “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” - unpatriotic, self-enriching, lying, scheming, tax dodging POS’s.Finally, about the book. I have read several of the recent trump uncovering books. Ward’s is by far the best written by a country mile. It reads more like a thriller than an expose.";Buy this one.;Words, not pictures;1556576011

1250217709;WOLFPACK: How to Come Together, Unleash Our Power, and Change the Game;R2LIVIAVJPHZ2M;5;Received this book this afternoon and read it in one sitting - which I never do. I barely read at all anymore because I stay home with my 2 daughters. This is a book full of lessons and wisdom I will read to my girls - a book they will receive when they can read so they have a constant reminder of their place in the world. As a former soccer player, the writing was relatable and fun to read. This book articulates lessons and rules to live by that sometimes I struggle to show my kids. Here’s to doing better - to championing one another as women, to raising a generation of strong, badass girls who are going to rule the world side by side. Thanks for reminding me, as their mom, that I, too, am the wolf. Sometimes calling myself “just a mom” or saying “I don’t work” wears on me - constantly feeling like I need to explain why or show them my bachelors degree or something - and this book is chock full of reminders for me that I am enough. Highly reccomend for anyone - but definitely mommas!;A Must Have for young girls;Jen Wolfe;1556800492
1250307503;The Path Made Clear: Discovering Your Life's Direction and Purpose;RUPSYEJ82WA3A;5;I stopped liking Oprah the day she belittled and ridiculed atheist guests on her show. That said, I do not think she sees reality enough to write advice to others on how to live. I gave this book a try, hoping maybe after so many years she might have changed. I can't say I read the whole thing because I could not stomach it all the way through. Oprah needs to learn that other people feel just as strongly in their beliefs as she does in hers. Yes, believe it or not, atheists are capable of wonder. Christians do not have a monopoly on that, or on the capacity to show and to feel love or compassion. Grow up, Oprah. It would be nice if you could be woman I thought you were way back when. For someone who thinks she is wise, you are extremely opinionated and close-minded.;Oprah Should to Apologize to Atheists;Brie Simmons;1556594080
1250313570;The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World;REUGGYRI5IVPN;5;Melinda Gates has dedicated her life to solving some of the world's biggest problems, and in this book she documents some of that work with searing individual stories as well as exposing her own struggles, conflicts, pain, and hard-won personal experience -- a vulnerability both very brave and also what I think gives the book such power to relate and ultimately to change minds. The individual stories across so many of her goals and missions bring the Gates Foundation's efforts to life and puts personal faces on these traumas that most of her readers are lucky enough to never experience themselves. I found myself relating to the individuals, picturing them in their homes, with their families, enduring what life has dealt them. I also love how the personal dynamic and relationship between Melinda and her husband Bill weaves throughout. The world is also a better place because of not only the work Melinda does, but because of her ability to bring her heart into the center of the discussions.;Compelling world-changing work coupled with deeply personal stories;Ilovemydogs;1557143395

1250313570;The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World;R39WW7RUN122LD;5;"The important points of Melinda 's book are: 1) Just to give money is not enough. It is a good point: for preceding generations,(and also here thanks to the American tax system that favors charity) many people gave away money without verifying how it was used. One example: when she was alive, nobody cared what Mother Theresa did with the donations she received. They should have. More donators today want to make sure that their money actually does some good. 2) Statistics are good enough to tell you there is a problem, but they don't tell you how to solve it. True: listening is an important weapon. This is mainly what the book is about: how to listen, and it is the best part of it. Making of this the only weapon we have to help people is a weakness of the book: empowering women helps but ignoring the damage caused by general corruption is a costly lack of candor (the reader who wants to know more should consult the corruption perception index on the web). 3) Individual stories and victories show well the path followed by Melinda in her work. Her tale of the discovery of the role of empowering women is excellent. I would have liked a chart showing the success of the groups she helped at the end of each chapter: there is one moment when statistics on results are helpful and convincing, even if we rejoice of the individual success stories. This is an excellent book, it could be more convincing with little effort. I was surprised that (because I know and agree the world is much better than one or two generations ago) I had already heard most of the stories told by the book in the 60s, told then by the grandmothers of the women Melinda interviews today. Cultures that keep people back are passed on by one generation to the next. Why? Because we believe what we have been told in childhood. It is disconcerting to see Melinda sustained by her faith in a church who made women responsible for the original sin.";Important message, poor construction: a second edition should be better;Khoa Pham;1557254149

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R30V6X1LLFWY7V;4;"I'd never read or listened to a Kristan Higgins book before, so I came with no preconceived notions of what kind of a book this was going to be -- truth is, I bought it partly because of the narrator, Xe Sands, because I've enjoyed other books she's narrated. And -- at least in the first part of this book -- I thought I was going to love it. I was hooked, big time.From the first page to somewhere in the middle, I was captivated. But then it started to change. A big part of the plot involves how Nora was treated/mistreated/ridiculed by almost everyone during her high school years, where she was fat, oily, hairy, miserable, lonely, friendless, etc etc. Then the teenage Nora sees a way out -- a college scholarship -- and she throws herself into the fight of her life, and ultimately wins a prestigious college scholarship. She gets her undergrad degree and goes on to medical school, establishing herself professionally and socially, not to mention losing weight, finding friends and becoming part of a pleasant community. She returns to Scupper Island only after having survived a car/pedestrian accident and losing her live-in lover at the same time.But returning to live with her mother isn't an easy fix either. Her mother hasn't changed -- she's still the non-communicative, non-demonstrative, person she always was, and Nora isn't made to feel welcome. Also living in the tiny home is Poe, a blue-haired, tattooed teenage replica of her mother, Nora's beautiful but bad-girl sister, who is currently serving time in prison in Washington State. Poe is angry, sullen, and lets Nora know she doesn't want her around either. Then Nora starts encountering her former HS classmates, who -- not surprisingly, I guess -- aren't making her feel welcome either. Nor are the townspeople, and during this part of the book, it's easy to feel sorry for poor rejected Nora. It's been 15 years since she lived here, you'd think high school issues -- Nora won the scholarship instead of a popular boy who everyone assumed would win it -- would have faded into the mists.Right about here a sea change takes place. You stop feeling sorry for Nora because she's been rejected and ridiculed so often, and start to feel annoyed with her because she sets herself up for it, time and time again. It gets painful to watch Nora do everything possible to win over all these people who never gave her what she needed in the past, and don't seem likely to do so now. Nora becomes pathetic, as she constantly strives to be loved, or at least accepted, but instead gets figuratively kicked in the teeth, time and time again. It's clearly time for her to shake the dust off her feet and move along, walk away, there being some situations --especially family ones -- that cannot be changed. That essentially is the plot of the book: How Nora plods along, with a sort of 'please.please like me' sticker on her forehead.I loved the part of the book in which much-maligned Nora fought, beat the odds and made something of herself. I didn't care for the pathetic Nora, who's willing to become everyone's doormat if they will just please like her a little bit Of course there's a happy ending, but by this time, Nora had - in my mind -- become such a weak and needy person I couldn't bring myself to enjoy much of anything she managed to accomplish. But maybe that's just me. Eventually, I suppose I will listen to this book again. Maybe next time I'll see some redeeming social value in it.";Starts great, but too much victimhood for Nora.;RRP;1557266831

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R3QBNQLXS97NJD;4;"I'd never read or listened to a Kristan Higgins book before, so I came with no preconceived notions of what kind of a book this was going to be -- truth is, I bought it partly because of the narrator, Xe Sands, because I've enjoyed other books she's narrated. And -- at least in the first part of this book -- I thought I was going to love it. I was hooked, big time.From the first page to somewhere in the middle, I was captivated. But then it started to change. A big part of the plot involves how Nora was treated/mistreated/ridiculed by almost everyone during her high school years, where she was fat, oily, hairy, miserable, lonely, friendless, etc etc. Then the teenage Nora sees a way out -- a college scholarship -- and she throws herself into the fight of her life, and ultimately wins a prestigious college scholarship. She gets her undergrad degree and goes on to medical school, establishing herself professionally and socially, not to mention losing weight, finding friends and becoming part of a pleasant community. She returns to Scupper Island only after having survived a car/pedestrian accident and losing her live-in lover at the same time.But returning to live with her mother isn't an easy fix either. Her mother hasn't changed -- she's still the non-communicative, non-demonstrative, person she always was, and Nora isn't made to feel welcome. Also living in the tiny home is Poe, a blue-haired, tattooed teenage replica of her mother, Nora's beautiful but bad-girl sister, who is currently serving time in prison in Washington State. Poe is angry, sullen, and lets Nora know she doesn't want her around either. Then Nora starts encountering her former HS classmates, who -- not surprisingly, I guess -- aren't making her feel welcome either. Nor are the townspeople, and during this part of the book, it's easy to feel sorry for poor rejected Nora. It's been 15 years since she lived here, you'd think high school issues -- Nora won the scholarship instead of a popular boy who everyone assumed would win it -- would have faded into the mists.Right about here a sea change takes place. You stop feeling sorry for Nora because she's been rejected and ridiculed so often, and start to feel annoyed with her because she sets herself up for it, time and time again. It gets painful to watch Nora do everything possible to win over all these people who never gave her what she needed in the past, and don't seem likely to do so now. Nora becomes pathetic, as she constantly strives to be loved, or at least accepted, but instead gets figuratively kicked in the teeth, time and time again. It's clearly time for her to shake the dust off her feet and move along, walk away, there being some situations --especially family ones -- that cannot be changed. That essentially is the plot of the book: How Nora plods along, with a sort of 'please.please like me' sticker on her forehead.I loved the part of the book in which much-maligned Nora fought, beat the odds and made something of herself. I didn't care for the pathetic Nora, who's willing to become everyone's doormat if they will just please like her a little bit Of course there's a happy ending, but by this time, Nora had - in my mind -- become such a weak and needy person I couldn't bring myself to enjoy much of anything she managed to accomplish. But maybe that's just me. Eventually, I suppose I will listen to this book again.

I decided on four because it is a decent read with interesting characters that are quirky, different and have depth to them. Some of my 'angst' with the book was the main character--Nora Stuart. She couldn't seem to leave the past behind. Being a doctor one would think she would know a little psychology and know enough to get some major help if she was unable to deal with the past.

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R2163XSCGO6HUR;4;"Another really solid, enjoyable read by the author. Kristan Higgins is very skilled at writing characters that you might not necessarily have much in common with, but yet you feel fully invested in them and root for them on their journey to finding whatever it is that will bring them happiness. That might sound like a simple thing, but I have read so many books lately in which I just felt zero connection to the characters and their storylines.Fifteen years ago Nora left the tiny Maine island town she grew up in and studied her butt off in college and medical school. She's working as a doctor in Boston when she's injured in a car accident. She decides to spend a few months recuperating in Maine even though her mother and the town isn't exactly going to roll out the welcome mat for her. But maybe with a little effort on her part, Nora will be able to repair long fractured relationships and build a few new ones as well.This isn't an overly complicated story but that doesn't mean that there isn't some depth here either. Nora's backstory and the events of her life that shaped her as a person were interesting to read and were what really drove the story. I loved the interactions between her and the romantic lead in the story as well as her female friendships. So many good relationship dynamics in play here. When I first started reading, I wasn't expecting for this to turn into an emotional read but there were quite a few touching moments throughout.Definitely recommend not just as a good romance read but also if you like books that feature strong female characters.";Touching story with strong female lead;RRP;1557209969

And -- at least in the first part of this book -- I thought I was going to love it. I was hooked, big time.From the first page to somewhere in the middle, I was captivated. But then it started to change. A big part of the plot involves how Nora was treated/mistreated/ridiculed by almost everyone during her high school years, where she was fat, oily, hairy, miserable, lonely, friendless, etc etc. Then the teenage Nora sees a way out -- a college scholarship -- and she throws herself into the fight of her life, and ultimately wins a prestigious college scholarship. She gets her undergrad degree and goes on to medical school, establishing herself professionally and socially, not to mention losing weight, finding friends and becoming part of a pleasant community. She returns to Scupper Island only after having survived a car/pedestrian accident and losing her live-in lover at the same time.But returning to live with her mother isn't an easy fix either. Her mother hasn't changed -- she's still the non-communicative, non-demonstrative, person she always was, and Nora isn't made to feel welcome. Also living in the tiny home is Poe, a blue-haired, tattooed teenage replica of her mother, Nora's beautiful but bad-girl sister, who is currently serving time in prison in Washington State. Poe is angry, sullen, and lets Nora know she doesn't want her around either. Then Nora starts encountering her former HS classmates, who -- not surprisingly, I guess -- aren't making her feel welcome either. Nor are the townspeople, and during this part of the book, it's easy to feel sorry for poor rejected Nora. It's been 15 years since she lived here, you'd think high school issues -- Nora won the scholarship instead of a popular boy who everyone assumed would win it -- would have faded into the mists.Right about here a sea change takes place. You stop feeling sorry for Nora because she's been rejected and ridiculed so often, and start to feel annoyed with her because she sets herself up for it, time and time again. It gets painful to watch Nora do everything possible to win over all these people who never gave her what she needed in the past, and don't seem likely to do so now. Nora becomes pathetic, as she constantly strives to be loved, or at least accepted, but instead gets figuratively kicked in the teeth, time and time again. It's clearly time for her to shake the dust off her feet and move along, walk away, there being some situations --especially family ones -- that cannot be changed.

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R3SAWW57NHN6SZ;4;"Another really solid, enjoyable read by the author. Kristan Higgins is very skilled at writing characters that you might not necessarily have much in common with, but yet you feel fully invested in them and root for them on their journey to finding whatever it is that will bring them happiness. That might sound like a simple thing, but I have read so many books lately in which I just felt zero connection to the characters and their storylines.Fifteen years ago Nora left the tiny Maine island town she grew up in and studied her butt off in college and medical school. She's working as a doctor in Boston when she's injured in a car accident. She decides to spend a few months recuperating in Maine even though her mother and the town isn't exactly going to roll out the welcome mat for her. But maybe with a little effort on her part, Nora will be able to repair long fractured relationships and build a few new ones as well.This isn't an overly complicated story but that doesn't mean that there isn't some depth here either. Nora's backstory and the events of her life that shaped her as a person were interesting to read and were what really drove the story. I loved the interactions between her and the romantic lead in the story as well as her female friendships. So many good relationship dynamics in play here. When I first started reading, I wasn't expecting for this to turn into an emotional read but there were quite a few touching moments throughout.Definitely recommend not just as a good romance read but also if you like books that feature strong female characters.";Touching story with strong female lead;RRP;1557210029

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R1082B3RFTUWIM;4;"I'd never read or listened to a Kristan Higgins book before, so I came with no preconceived notions of what kind of a book this was going to be -- truth is, I bought it partly because of the narrator, Xe Sands, because I've enjoyed other books she's narrated. And -- at least in the first part of this book -- I thought I was going to love it. I was hooked, big time.From the first page to somewhere in the middle, I was captivated. But then it started to change. A big part of the plot involves how Nora was treated/mistreated/ridiculed by almost everyone during her high school years, where she was fat, oily, hairy, miserable, lonely, friendless, etc etc. Then the teenage Nora sees a way out -- a college scholarship -- and she throws herself into the fight of her life, and ultimately wins a prestigious college scholarship. She gets her undergrad degree and goes on to medical school, establishing herself professionally and socially, not to mention losing weight, finding friends and becoming part of a pleasant community. She returns to Scupper Island only after having survived a car/pedestrian accident and losing her live-in lover at the same time.But returning to live with her mother isn't an easy fix either. Her mother hasn't changed -- she's still the non-communicative, non-demonstrative, person she always was, and Nora isn't made to feel welcome. Also living in the tiny home is Poe, a blue-haired, tattooed teenage replica of her mother, Nora's beautiful but bad-girl sister, who is currently serving time in prison in Washington State. Poe is angry, sullen, and lets Nora know she doesn't want her around either. Then Nora starts encountering her former HS classmates, who -- not surprisingly, I guess -- aren't making her feel welcome either. Nor are the townspeople, and during this part of the book, it's easy to feel sorry for poor rejected Nora. It's been 15 years since she lived here, you'd think high school issues -- Nora won the scholarship instead of a popular boy who everyone assumed would win it -- would have faded into the mists.Right about here a sea change takes place. You stop feeling sorry for Nora because she's been rejected and ridiculed so often, and start to feel annoyed with her because she sets herself up for it, time and time again. It gets painful to watch Nora do everything possible to win over all these people who never gave her what she needed in the past, and don't seem likely to do so now. Nora becomes pathetic, as she constantly strives to be loved, or at least accepted, but instead gets figuratively kicked in the teeth, time and time again. It's clearly time for her to shake the dust off her feet and move along, walk away, there being some situations --especially family ones -- that cannot be changed. That essentially is the plot of the book: How Nora plods along, with a sort of 'please.please like me' sticker on her forehead.I loved the part of the book in which much-maligned Nora fought, beat the odds and made something of herself. I didn't care for the pathetic Nora, who's willing to become everyone's doormat if they will just please like her a little bit Of course there's a happy ending, but by this time, Nora had - in my mind -- become such a weak and needy person I couldn't bring myself to enjoy much of anything she managed to accomplish. But maybe that's just me. Eventually, I suppose I will listen to this book again. Maybe next time I'll see some redeeming social value in it.";Starts great, but too much victimhood for Nora.;RRP;1557264096

1335915273;Now That You Mention It;R3GG63SIDX0WBV;4;"Another really solid, enjoyable read by the author. Kristan Higgins is very skilled at writing characters that you might not necessarily have much in common with, but yet you feel fully invested in them and root for them on their journey to finding whatever it is that will bring them happiness. That might sound like a simple thing, but I have read so many books lately in which I just felt zero connection to the characters and their storylines.Fifteen years ago Nora left the tiny Maine island town she grew up in and studied her butt off in college and medical school. She's working as a doctor in Boston when she's injured in a car accident. She decides to spend a few months recuperating in Maine even though her mother and the town isn't exactly going to roll out the welcome mat for her. But maybe with a little effort on her part, Nora will be able to repair long fractured relationships and build a few new ones as well.This isn't an overly complicated story but that doesn't mean that there isn't some depth here either. Nora's backstory and the events of her life that shaped her as a person were interesting to read and were what really drove the story. I loved the interactions between her and the romantic lead in the story as well as her female friendships. So many good relationship dynamics in play here. When I first started reading, I wasn't expecting for this to turn into an emotional read but there were quite a few touching moments throughout.Definitely recommend not just as a good romance read but also if you like books that feature strong female characters.";Touching story with strong female lead;RRP;1557207600

That might sound like a simple thing, but I have read so many books lately in which I just felt zero connection to the characters and their storylines.Fifteen years ago Nora left the tiny Maine island town she grew up in and studied her butt off in college and medical school. She's working as a doctor in Boston when she's injured in a car accident. She decides to spend a few months recuperating in Maine even though her mother and the town isn't exactly going to roll out the welcome mat for her. But maybe with a little effort on her part, Nora will be able to repair long fractured relationships and build a few new ones as well.This isn't an overly complicated story but that doesn't mean that there isn't some depth here either.

I loved the interactions between her and the romantic lead in the story as well as her female friendships. So many good relationship dynamics in play here.

And -- at least in the first part of this book -- I thought I was going to love it. I was hooked, big time.From the first page to somewhere in the middle, I was captivated. But then it started to change. A big part of the plot involves how Nora was treated/mistreated/ridiculed by almost everyone during her high school years, where she was fat, oily, hairy, miserable, lonely, friendless, etc etc. Then the teenage Nora sees a way out -- a college scholarship -- and she throws herself into the fight of her life, and ultimately wins a prestigious college scholarship. She gets her undergrad degree and goes on to medical school, establishing herself professionally and socially, not to mention losing weight, finding friends and becoming part of a pleasant community. She returns to Scupper Island only after having survived a car/pedestrian accident and losing her live-in lover at the same time.But returning to live with her mother isn't an easy fix either. Her mother hasn't changed -- she's still the non-communicative, non-demonstrative, person she always was, and Nora isn't made to feel welcome. Also living in the tiny home is Poe, a blue-haired, tattooed teenage replica of her mother, Nora's beautiful but bad-girl sister, who is currently serving time in prison in Washington State. Poe is angry, sullen, and lets Nora know she doesn't want her around either. Then Nora starts encountering her former HS classmates, who -- not surprisingly, I guess -- aren't making her feel welcome either. Nor are the townspeople, and during this part of the book, it's easy to feel sorry for poor rejected Nora. It's been 15 years since she lived here, you'd think high school issues -- Nora won the scholarship instead of a popular boy who everyone assumed would win it -- would have faded into the mists.Right about here a sea change takes place. You stop feeling sorry for Nora because she's been rejected and ridiculed so often, and start to feel annoyed with her because she sets herself up for it, time and time again. It gets painful to watch Nora do everything possible to win over all these people who never gave her what she needed in the past, and don't seem likely to do so now. Nora becomes pathetic, as she constantly strives to be loved, or at least accepted, but instead gets figuratively kicked in the teeth, time and time again. It's clearly time for her to shake the dust off her feet and move along, walk away, there being some situations --especially family ones -- that cannot be changed. That essentially is the plot of the book: How Nora plods along, with a sort of 'please.please like me' sticker on her forehead.I loved the part of the book in which much-maligned Nora fought, beat the odds and made something of herself. I didn't care for the pathetic Nora, who's willing to become everyone's doormat if they will just please like her a little bit Of course there's a happy ending, but by this time, Nora had - in my mind -- become such a weak and needy person I couldn't bring myself to enjoy much of anything she managed to accomplish.

I loved Girl Wash Your Face and have been following Rachel Hollis for a few years. Girl Wash Your Face laid out many of the lies we tell ourselves and had lots of funny, relatable stories. This book dives deeper and provides much more concrete advice and ideas on how to actually move forward and reach for more in our personal or professional lives. She lays out excuses to let go of, behaviors to adopt and skills to acquire in the pursuit of achieving a goal. What I appreciate about this book is that you don't have to be an entrepreneur or business woman to take something from it. I am a stay at home mom, but I still feel there are many ways I want to reach for more and improve my life. The strategies and ideas in the book are concrete enough that I feel I can take a lot from it, while also being general enough to be valuable to anyone from a CEO to a stay at home mom.;Girl, stop waiting and read this book!;Sara V. Howard;1557384880
1400209609;Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals;R15HZTBTHKJH15;3;"I recognize that my opinion may not be a popular one, but it is just that. My opinion.  It is important to note that Rachel Hollis is an inspiration to me. She is indeed my guru and personal development coach. I found out about her and her work about 6 months ago through social media. I truly believe that her tools and wisdom have changed my life. So naturally, I signed up for her life coaching, purchased her start today journals and books and look forward to her weekly podcasts. I live for these tools. To say I am a fan is an understatement. So of course, I was stalking the mailman on Tuesday so I could rip open the amazon box and devour this new book. The husband was pre-warned that I would be distracted! Sadly, I was a little put off by the book if I am being honest.Rachel’s message in this book is truly one that I and many other women NEED to hear. I just didn’t care for HOW this message was delivered at all. Her storytelling felt forced and not as natural as in Girl, Wash Your Face. Her message also sounded so judgmental and angry to me; not the Rachel “I know” through social media and monthly coaching. That Rachel is a badass and so motivating. This Rachel sounded entitled and all knowing. I also felt she was not relatable at all. Her story of her 11th birthday made me put the book down for a minute. I remember as a teenager, we could not afford a sweet 16 party at a fancy hall like my other friends. But my mom, God Bless her, gave me the best birthday that she could. Despite living paycheck to paycheck, she saved money so that I could have a party in our yard. Was I embarrassed that this was all we could afford? No. What embarrassed me, was reading this section in the book. I also could not relate to her “letting her 850,000 fans down” when GWYF was not an instant best seller. Last I checked, the book is doing great.The 3rd part of this book is where the true magic lies. The chapters on planning and establishing a foundation are so motivational to me, I feel as though they were written just for me. If you follow Rachel on social media or on her blog, you likely have access to this information and likely don’t need the book. Look for her 5 to thrive and check out the Made for More movie on Amazon. The last 30 minutes of bonus content are AMAZING and Rachel highlights much of this advice there.While I did not love the book, I do love the overall message it conveys. I am made for more and will not apologize…to anyone… for that (or for this review for that matter).";Wanted to love, but sadly, just like;Stefanie;1557218701

She breaks down all of the excuses we find when we don't want to work hard for results. She is candid and relies on personal experiences to share her personal belief system and what works for her. She is real, fresh and poignant.

I didn’t think it was possible to come close to GWYF but somehow Rachel made it happen and the book is a game changer!! The content in GSA is very inspiring, extremely motivating and super actionable. Rachel is so real and she has been through what so many of us are going through...this is what makes her so relatable.

1400209609;Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals;R2RTM17JXKLULE;5;"The book is incredible, as is to be expected from Rachel Hollis. Yes, there are ideas and phrases I have heard her say before as someone that follows her pretty religiously, but this is a deep dive. Not every chapter resonated with me, as is to be expected, but still a great read. I gained so many ideas to implement in becoming the best version of myself by reading this book. So many that I'm going to have to get myself a new highlighter because I wore this one out!!Definitely worth a read - even if the ideas aren't new to you, everyone can always use a reminder or two. I would be surprised if someone couldn't find SOMETHING in this book that will better their lives. If you don't, maybe you should read the chapter on positivity again... ;)";Great Read;Kelsey;1556876901
1400209609;Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals;R79ZOYH4GPA3V;5;"To say I was excited for this book release is a gross understatement. I fell in love with Rachel after reading Girl, Wash Your Face. This book I was especially excited for because it was said to have a lot of content about starting a goal (for me, that is a business) and how to keep on track.As expected, this book didn't disappoint. I am usually skeptical of books that get a lot of hype because they tend not to live up to it. Thankfully, and much to my excitement, this one did without a doubt.This book spoke to me on so many different themes. Of course, the most obvious, is to not apologize for going after your dreams and goals. If you listen to others who tell you \Maybe that isn't the best idea for you.\"" or \""Are you sure you want to do that?\"", you will continue to put off your dreams and goals, or just give up on them entirely.Another theme I found very motivating was about goals. If you have many goals you are trying to achieve, you can't put proper focus on one and you will likely fail at them all. By focusing on a single goal, making a roadmap with guide points and mile markers, you are able to achieve these goals and also have tangible results from day-to-day activity from it.Overall, this book was exactly what I wanted it to be. It was motivating, insightful, and uplifting. This world needs more leaders, no matter their background. Rachel doesn't disappoint, and couldn't be more spot on with her material, yet again. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a goal to achieve or a dream they want to pursue!""";Amazing Read;Kate Metzler;1557375504

Heck, yes!!! Will I buy it on audible and listen to it several times? Yes!!! Will I re-read the half of the book I highlighted? Yes!!! Do I think everyone will love it? Yes! And maybe no!...because that’s life and that’s ok.If someone is looking to critique or for her to perform they will find reasons not to like it. If someone values her intention to better their life and help them get further down the path by speaking truth into them, they’ll love it!💗Her heart is pure and her intention is to coach us through what may be keeping us stuck and get us to the other side. She feels like a friend. Not the friend who tells you you are perfect in every way but a friend who says let’s chat about the things, the places you doubt yourself, the place you believe you aren’t enough, the place you let your dreams go to exist through life and quite possibly are losing yourself in the process.

At first I was unsure if this book would be relevant, or apply to me since I don’t have big goals of running my own empire so to speak. “Girl, Wash Your Face” completely changed my mindset, so I tore into this book as soon as I got it, highlighter in hand, curious to see what I would learn.Girl- there is so much practical wisdom and blunt truth throughout the entire book! This book is for the stay at home mama as well as the woman running the Fortune 500 company! I love how Rachel has divided this book into three different sections, “Excuses to Let Go of,” “Behaviors to Adopt,” and “Skills to Acquire.” No matter where you are in your journey of becoming the best version of yourself, you will gain wisdom and practical application. This book will help you be the best person you can be in your home life, your work life, and your personal life.This book is one that I will be rereading many times because the truth will always be relevant and applicable.

I had heard of Rachel Hollis through mutual book friends, but it wasn't until my bestie recommended reading Girl, Wash Your Face that I truly got it. Hollis inspired a change in me that I never expected and I am so grateful for all I have learned from her.Girl, Stop Apologizing is a follow up, but can be read as a standalone. The book provides introspection and encourages you to live the life you are meant to live. Hollis is the first to say that looks different for everyone, but the message is the same for everyone. We shouldn't be ashamed to be dreamers or to have goals that others may not understand or agree with. We should live the life we were meant to be and let the haters hate.\Sis, don't be afraid of failure. Be afraid of never achieving anything at all because you were too afraid of what others might think of you trying.\""The part I love the most about is the real life advice on how to achieve you goals. I love that Hollis isn't like 'go get it girl' without actually telling you what worked for her. The book is like having a bestie who has done all the research and is now saying this is what worked for me. It's a guide for you to read and apply what may work in your situation.If you have spoken to me in the last year I have told you about Rachel Hollis. Her words have inspired me and made me a better person! So obviously I am telling you now, if you do anything for yourself read this book.

1400209609;Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals;R37TQ4P2QXINB8;4;"Rachel Hollis' first book, \Girl, Wash Your Face\"" was a book I gained so much from. I related to much of what she was saying and realized some of the struggles I was dealing with were ones that other women were facing, too. In fact, GWYF was a motivation for me to get better about being sure I was making time for self care, restarted my journey towards a healthier lifestyle, as well as helped me become more productive in my work at a non-profit, which I feel is my calling.\""Girl, Stop Apologizing,\"" is her second book, and while I found much information that would be helpful to those in business or seeking to \""create their own empire,\"" the message of the book did not connect with me. Granted, I am probably not in the target demographic, as I am confident in where I am at this stage in my life. Goal setting and continuing to adjust how my dreams might look is par for the course for me right now. For someone who is not familiar with how to get started in this venture, \""Girl, Stop Apologizing\"" will offer suggestions from Rachel's entrepreneurial journey and provide concrete ways to set workable goals.While GWYF was more of an inspirational, \""friend who has your best interests at heart\"" read, this book read a little more like a guideline on how to succeed in business, which I wouldn't have first guessed by the title. I was hoping it had more to do with being intentional in accepting where you are in life or who you are without apologizing for it. However, this book might be good for someone who is running their own business or has lofty goals for creating a new business.Rachel's publisher did change between GWYF and this book, so be aware that this book was not marketed by a Christian publishing house. I am all for emphasis, but I have always been told that intelligence should not be hidden behind \""colorful\"" language.I was able to glean quite a few things on leadership from the book, though, and as I said before, I am probably not the target audience.

I was lucky enough to get an advanced readers copy in order to read this gem early.  I’m not going to lie, reading this has helped to reinforce the strength and grit I have within myself, but often I suppress because I don’t want to upset anyone else.  She reminds me and validates that it’s ok to take care of myself first and above all to Stop Apologizing for it!  Thank You Rachel for reminding me (and all of us) to go for it.;Sorry Not Sorry - Buy it now!!!!;Jamie n Christina;1557369100
1400209609;Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals;R3PDGUUGKKZ2K8;4;I love her honesty in all she does. Much of the content in the book seems to be the same as what she talks of publicly on social media, but it's never a bad thing to hear things over and over until it sticks.  While I do not agree on all points made in the book, I do believe her heart is in the right place when she writes.  I find motivation in many of her words so I will hold onto those instead of reviewing based on the few points I disagreed with.People leaving awful reviews need to check themselves out in the mirror. Has everything they've done been perfection? Likely not.  She is not privileged. She has worked HARD to get to where she is now. It amazes me how other women want to tear down another woman who has made it.Do I wish she held back on the couple of swear words, yes. She is being herself though. Unapologetically. And guess what. Good for her!;Have some grace;WIIF;1557295035

What he's teaching can change your life. Once you understand why the same old things keep happening in your life over and over...why the illnesses seem to continue to manifest...why things don't change no matter how hard you try - then real self-transformation can occur. Dr. Joe shares first-hand accounts of healing/personal transformation in this book. I love learning about people who have overcome seemingly impossible odds. Becoming Supernatural is truly possible.

1401953115;Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…;ROQPQDQSQECT0;5;His latest book is the greatest. I have now read all Dr. Joe's books including the first one what the bleep. Joe has a fantastic facility to be able to take the most complicated functions of our mind and explain them to a child. It is a pleasure to watch his progression as he trips through the Erie world mysticism and science.As usual, once you understand things they never seem complicated again. I heard Joe's message about just rehearsing actions in your mind. However, I never really got it until this time. Despite the fact that in principle I practice that very same thing to change the physical habit I had.I haven't finished reading this book and I'm already looking forward to more enlightenment with the next one.By this book it will change your life.;This book will definitely change your life for the better!;Ron Mahon;1556594584
1401953115;Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…;RARTXJIQBS6CC;5;I picked up Dr Joe's latest book at his Progressive Workshop in London last weekend having read his other books, and following his meditations for a couple of years.  I have to agree with other reviewers and say that this book is the best one yet, and Placebo completely blew me away.  With Placebo, I finally had the scientific evidence I needed to turn my hopes about the power of thought and epigenetics into real belief.  Until then I just really wanted to believe this stuff.Becoming Supernatural takes this amazing information one step further by providing even more cutting edge info and more of a framework on how to channel your mind and your energy.  For me, there's no substitute for an actual live event, and for Dr Joe in person, but this book is important as a compliment to the events when you just can't write it all down fast enough, and on it's own before, between and after events.  It's mandatory reading.  Don't hesitate to buy it and dive in.;Mandatory reading - the best one yet!;Ilikespoons;1557377544

1401953115;Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…;R3927A36CNFWD5;5;"I found Dr. Joe last year right as I was ending a 14 year relationship. Everything I knew was changing, I was at as low a place I have ever been, I felt completely broken. I happened to run across a video series from Dr. Joe and I was so beat down that I watched it and listened to what he had to say. The scientific nature of the material appealed to the academic in me, finally there was proof that real change was possible beyond just taping mantas around the house and trying to think \positively\"". Perhaps because I was at such a low point and felt I had no other options that I hadn't already exploited, I dug in. I bought \""Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself\"" and instead of just reading it for the philosophical information, I actually did the exercises. For the first time in my life I began to meditate. In the meantime I was looking everywhere for more information on this subject and I found that Dr. Joe is not the only scientist to be saying these same things. I discovered Dr. Bruce Lipton, Gregg Braden and others that are extolling the benefits of doing this inner work to change the programming we all received as children and that we now are trying to change. It all made sense to me in a way that nothing before really had...or maybe I just had never tried before because I was pretty well convinced of 'who I was', I was an angry person that didn't deserve for great things to happen for me...no one in our family tree had ever been successful...who did I think I was to want to be happy?? I had so much anger from a lifetime spent processing these same damn emotions of lack, fear, sadness, unworthiness and a host of others that I was like a tinder box, always on the verge of exploding! I had spent my entire life not caring if I lived another day or not because I thought I would never escape those internal monologues and the pain was wearing me down. But I kept doing the meditations every morning no matter what ( I haven't missed a day since sometime at the end of last Feb) and slowly I started to feel the change. It was like literally for the first time in my adult life I felt something other than fear and dread. I felt joy, complete joy for life and my place in it. I continue to study Dr. Joe's work and I believe in my heart that this information has not only saved my life but made it worth living. I am dedicating my Self to learn as much as I can so that I can help others know that there is a different path, one that offers true transformation. I can't express in words the difference I feel inside but the change is real and it is profound! I am thankful beyond measure for all the brave people that are showing us this truth, first among them I offer Dr. Joe my heartfelt gratitude.""";All I can say it that this information changed my life-I am not the person I was a year ago!;Cat Belue;1556592561
1401953115;Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…;RPP8PJOMXUIEO;5;"\Becoming Supernatural\"" is another stellar work by Dr. Joe Dispenza. I have followed his work from the \""What the Bleep\"" era and watched him push through new boundaries with brain science, quantum physics, epigenetic work and more. This book contains comprehensive explanations of concepts he teaches in his workshops that you can practice at home. Dr. Joe is adept at demystifying \""miracles\"" so the reader is capable transforming personal life pain into a healing experience. I have downloaded his meditations and know it works! I recommend his work - he shares much wisdom, his lectures are fantastic and offers so much knowledge for free via youtube & his website.

1401953115;Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…;R2WNRAHS21R202;5;"I have been eagerly awaiting this new book from Dr Joe  and am happy to say it fulfilled all my expectations and then some. Dr Joe loves sharing the “how to” of personal change, which is what is lacking in a lot of New Age, Law of Attraction type books.  This book is chock full of methods, a tool kit of personal change – different guided meditations, meditation seated, meditation walking, Mind Movies, etc. He  inspires and encourages further with numerous tales of those who have used his methods and achieved success and happiness by transforming their health, their careers, their family lives and more. He also delves even more into the mystical elements in this book, unlike his previous books which were far more scientific in tone. I’ve been a fan of Dr Joe for some time now and have been “doing the work.” I have with this book even more tools to bring it to a whole new level of change for myself. I’ve heard him describe “lighting a match in a dark place” to reveal the unconscious behaviors and patterns in our mind which don’t serve us, so that we can rewrite the program to patterns that do serve us well. I never thought I would find myself happily meditating every day; with the results that this achieves, and the joy that it brings, it’s now an easy thing to do. I find myself with the remarkable ability to light that match and act upon what I see.";This book is chock full of methods, a tool kit of personal change;563rob;1556592589

It is written in a very conversational yet straight-forward manner and you will feel as though the author, fitness expert Chalene Johnson, is speaking directly to you. There is a ton of information in this book revolving around the latest research in nutrition, especially that which focuses on gut health and inflammation. Johnson makes the information accessible and understandable. I could barely put the book down!There are tons of additional little \handwritten\"" notes sprinkled throughout the text that make it easy to focus on the most important parts.

From \Your parents were wrong\"" to \""kill your phone\"" to \""I'm a fake\"" and \""Make work that matters\"" James is unashamed, brutally honest, and practical. Each idea is challenging to things that I have struggled with or still struggle with and it's such a refreshing change of pace in the creative realm.

1455595373;Crushing: God Turns Pressure into Power;R24Z8HO51CWSBD;4;"In Crushing: God Turns Pressure into Power  Bishop T.D. Jakes tells us his story about how the pain and suffering he has experienced in his life turned out to be a good thing. He begins his book sharing with us the tragedy of the death of his mother, who was afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease. His mother profoundly influenced Bishop Jakes life and to watch her slowly lose her mind and then her life left him with these questions many of us have asked. “Do we have to suffer so much in this life in order to mature in faith? Why would a good Father allow his children to suffer so much pain, injustice, and heartache?”Bishop Jakes follows up his story about his mother with his thirteen year old daughter’s announcement to him and his wife as they were sitting out on their porch that she was pregnant. For Bishop Jakes, a well-known and respected minister and author, this announcement shook him deeply. How could he have failed his daughter so badly and what would people think about this man who preached righteousness, but who could not even influence for good his own daughter?Many readers of Bishop Jakes story will be able to easily relate to his suffering, but perhaps will have more difficulty agreeing with his conclusion that “We may not want to admit it, but what if our crushing is necessary for our potential to be fulfilled?” And then he asks us: “Can you see the necessity of being crushed as part of your maturation process to fulfill God’s plan?” If readers of this review answer yes to this question, they are going to find much to like in Bishop Jakes book.Bishop Jakes uses Bible stories like the Vinedresser turning his grapes into wine to suggest that like grapes we must first be crushed to become good wine or good people. He says that “No matter who we are, where we are in life, or where we come from, we must begin to appreciate the ugly stages of our inception.” In contrast to Bishop Jakes, I consider our inception to be beautiful and wonderful. Then he says, “When we allow the Lord to shift our mindset, we begin to see that everything that has happened to us has happened for a reason.” I don’t agree. I think that much that happens to people is accidental; we can be either in the right or wrong place at any time. He concludes with his vinedresser analogy. He says, “If we look back at the sprout (us) that pushed itself through the ceiling of dirt above it, we discover reasons behind our adversity that were previously invisible and unimaginable but now are suddenly apparent and miraculous when we arrive at the fruit-bearing stage.”Again, some readers of this review may find that Bishop Jakes creative attempt to understand pain and suffering and our need to be crushed if we are to grow and develop as people makes sense. For me it is not sense, but nonsense. Jesus came, not that we might be crushed, but that “we might have life and have it to the full.\ If readers of this review want to read what some thoughtful writers have to say about suffering, I suggest C.S. Lewis or G.K. Chesterton, not Bishop Jakes.""";Long sermon on what it means to be crushed.;Man in the Middle;1556806340

1455595373;Crushing: God Turns Pressure into Power;R1C0YFK1XNR7BH;4;"In Crushing: God Turns Pressure into Power  Bishop T.D. Jakes tells us his story about how the pain and suffering he has experienced in his life turned out to be a good thing. He begins his book sharing with us the tragedy of the death of his mother, who was afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease. His mother profoundly influenced Bishop Jakes life and to watch her slowly lose her mind and then her life left him with these questions many of us have asked. “Do we have to suffer so much in this life in order to mature in faith? Why would a good Father allow his children to suffer so much pain, injustice, and heartache?”Bishop Jakes follows up his story about his mother with his thirteen year old daughter’s announcement to him and his wife as they were sitting out on their porch that she was pregnant. For Bishop Jakes, a well-known and respected minister and author, this announcement shook him deeply. How could he have failed his daughter so badly and what would people think about this man who preached righteousness, but who could not even influence for good his own daughter?Many readers of Bishop Jakes story will be able to easily relate to his suffering, but perhaps will have more difficulty agreeing with his conclusion that “We may not want to admit it, but what if our crushing is necessary for our potential to be fulfilled?” And then he asks us: “Can you see the necessity of being crushed as part of your maturation process to fulfill God’s plan?” If readers of this review answer yes to this question, they are going to find much to like in Bishop Jakes book.Bishop Jakes uses Bible stories like the Vinedresser turning his grapes into wine to suggest that like grapes we must first be crushed to become good wine or good people. He says that “No matter who we are, where we are in life, or where we come from, we must begin to appreciate the ugly stages of our inception.” In contrast to Bishop Jakes, I consider our inception to be beautiful and wonderful. Then he says, “When we allow the Lord to shift our mindset, we begin to see that everything that has happened to us has happened for a reason.” I don’t agree. I think that much that happens to people is accidental; we can be either in the right or wrong place at any time. He concludes with his vinedresser analogy. He says, “If we look back at the sprout (us) that pushed itself through the ceiling of dirt above it, we discover reasons behind our adversity that were previously invisible and unimaginable but now are suddenly apparent and miraculous when we arrive at the fruit-bearing stage.”Again, some readers of this review may find that Bishop Jakes creative attempt to understand pain and suffering and our need to be crushed if we are to grow and develop as people makes sense.

1496406184;The Persian Gamble;R10K52M58X1KGV;5;Given our current geo-political climate, the timeliness of this book is unsettling and too plausible for comfort.  I hope everyone that reads this book takes the threat set forth in the plot seriously.  The Persian Gamble has overtaken a couple of Rosenberg’s other books as my new favorite.  I stayed up until 1:00 a.m. to finish it because I didn’t want to put it down.Marcus Ryker returns at the exact point he left us at the end of The Kremlin Conspiracy, the first book in this series, parachuting from a jetliner moments before it is shot down by the Russian military.  With him is the Russian double agent turned assassin who is THE one man with all of the information and contacts to stop an attack on the US.  There is plenty of action in the story as Ryker tries to get the Russian and himself safely out of Russia and to the US.  The question is whether the US leaders believe his story that the threat of nuclear attack is both real and imminent?  Or, will they label him as a traitor?Personal, professional, and national loyalties are questioned and tested.  Risks are taken, and the true cost of living in a free nation is shown us through the sacrifices of our nation’s military heroes.  The story moves across Russia, North Korea, Iran, and the U.S. as secret alliances are revealed and Ryker risks everything to save his country.If you did not read the first book in the series, The Kremlin Conspiracy, the author gives you enough information at the beginning of this book to understand the previous story.  I hope to see more books in this series as Mr. Rosenberg has set up Marcus Ryker to be a protagonist whose own losses and struggles are interwoven through the story and look to become as interesting as the stories themselves.Thank you to NetGalley and Tyndale House Publishers for providing me with an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.;What would happen if Russia, North Korea, and Iran formed an alliance?;Charlsa;1557259577

Knowing history is important and I thought i knew a little about the lives and performance of duty of most of our former presidents. Oh the things I did not know! To tell the truth, after reading this book, I am not as worried about our problems and our country's survival today as I might have been before reading it. The cronyism, the lack of concern for the welfare of our country, the perception of the unimportance of the Vice President's job and status, how little the VP was brought in on the affairs of state, and so many other historical factors that were revealed in this book. I really enjoyed reading it and greatly appreciate the tremendous amount of research that Jared Cohen conducted to get the facts he presented!;Extremely interesting book!;Jenna Goldberg;1557180400

1501138227;The Last Second (A Brit in the FBI);R1EY2J7VRV8TRM;5;"I've read two of this \Brit in the FBI\"" series and absolutely loved them both, so when I got the chance to wade into this one as an advance review copy, I was ecstatic. And guess what? The story is a bit more \""out there\"" than the others, but it's yet another 5-star winner in my book.The very likable characters, in particular special agents Nicholas Drummond and his sweetie, Michaela \""Mike\"" Caine, are back. The two are staying with friends and other regular characters Grant and Kitsune Thornton, while Mike nurses a nearly healed broken ankle that happened during a previous adventure. Mike and Nicholas head the FBI Covert Eyes Team, while Grant runs a private security company that's been hired to protect Jean-Pierre Broussard, the founder of Galactus Industries.In the prologue, readers learn that astronaut Dr. Nevaeh Patel was drummed out of the space program after a near-death experience during a spacewalking event, after which she claimed to have heard extraterrestrial voices called the Numen. No one believed her and most think she's gone bonkers - and thus unfit for another outer space mission. Insisting she's not crazy, Nevaeh quits the program, later hooking up with Broussard. He wants someone to take over that company while he searches the seas for the \""Holy Grail\"" - a rock believed to have healing powers.But Nevaeh has much more on her mind than running a company that puts small satellites in space at an affordable cost. Those voices never stopped calling, you see, and they're getting louder by the day - urging her to undertake a project that will disrupt the entire world and give them, and Nevaeh, total control. Once Mike and Nicholas learn what's going on, they have other ideas - but can they find a way to stop what she's about to make happen, even if it's at the last second?A good bit of the almost nonstop action takes place at sea, with scenes reminiscent (to me, at least) of Clive Cussler's NUMA Files books. As the two intersecting plots on land and water begin to seriously converge, all the characters get involved in ultra-dangerous situations that call for super-human feats, and the ending is worthy of an Ian Fleming 007 novel. My verdict? Thank goodness for one of the most boring Super Bowl games ever (and I haven't missed a single one since the 1967 inaugural game) that allowed me to finish the final third of the book nonstop. And speaking of thanks, I'll send some to the publisher, via NetGalley, for allowing me to read and review it.""";A Bit More 'Out There,' but Worthy Series Entry;Monnie Ryan;1557204847

1501161156;Lessons From Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old, Happy Dog;R15Y3FRMPZ8QA3;5;"Dave Barry is a well-known humorist. He has authored many books, both fiction and non-fiction. His accolades are sung throughout the land and rightly so. He has a Pulitzer Prize, is a NYT Best Selling Author, and even had a sitcom based on a couple of his books. As a columnist his funny takes on life and whatever else was in his head at the time have appeared in over 500 newspapers. Suffice it to be said lots and lots of people think he is funny, and I am certainly one of them.Lessons from Lucy is a self-help book. Normally I look at self-help books as though the pages are laced with arsenic and leave them on the shelves in the bookstores to die a slow and painful death sad and alone. But I have finally found a self-help book full of useful information that should be read by anyone and everyone. Especially if you are in what poets call the “sunset years”, but Lucy and Barry refer to as getting old. Everyone gets old and this book gives us all great insights to navigate old age with a lot more fun than you might think.Dogs are basically happy creatures. Barry captures the essence of happiness by studying Lucy’s reactions to situations such as meeting new people (or dogs). Lucy has an open mind about it once she sniffs them out. So should people. Not the sniffing part, but new friends and experiences are so much better than sitting around watching reruns all afternoon. So make some new friends and stay in touch with those you have. It will make you happy.Be present in the moment is another gem of wisdom. Be happy with who you are with and what you are doing and for goodness sakes put down that cell phone and actually have a conversation. See? Lucy is brilliant and she has a happy life because of her willingness to be happy where she is and with whom she is with.Each lesson is relatable and will stick with you, such as dealing with anger. Lucy gets mad at the garbage man, and then lets it go. People get mad and let it simmer all day, telling everyone about the horrible thing someone else did or did not do. Who doesn’t yell at the guy on his phone in front of you texting at the green light? Does it do any good? Nope, that guy is gonna do what he’s gonna do. Why get your blood pressure to the top of the chart over something you can’t do anything about? Be like Lucy and let it go.Barry might be a grumpy old man (his assessment, not mine) but he is still one of the funniest writers I have ever read. His take on life will leave you thinking about it long after you have stopped laughing at the hysterical delivery of his message. As he states, “getting old sucks” but goes on to tell the reader how to make it fun. Really, really fun.I recommend you grab this book and read it at least once, maybe twice because we all get old and you are going to need this info at some point. I am going to try and not be so grumpy, so opinionated and get out meeting more people and doing more things. I’ll stay connected with my friends and make new ones. Laughing more and living more sounds like the best advice I’ve ever read in a self-help book. I should have known a dog would make me a better human, but it took Dave Barry pointing it out for me to see it.DISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL CONNECTION: I have a material connection because I received a review copy for free from Netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.

1501168371;The Trial of Lizzie Borden;R2OUPSL141TEEE;5;"Lizzie Borden took an axeAnd gave her mother forty whacks.When she saw what she had done,She gave her father forty-one.On August 4, 1892, Andrew and Abby Borden were both brutally murdered in their home in Fall River, Massachusetts. After an investigation and inquest, which included her own testimony, Lizzie Borden was arrested and charged for the murder of Andrew Borden only. (This was later amended to add Abby Borden). What followed was the biggest US trial to date. Reporters were everywhere, people were clamoring to enter the courthouse to see the proceedings, and amateur sleuths were attempting to solve the mystery themselves. Ultimately, Lizzie was found not guilty by the jury of men.The above general information is fairly well-known (except maybe the initial complaint was only about the father). Robertson takes this and proceeds to give a carefully retelling of the entire saga – the murder, the trial, and the verdict. She outlines the family dynamic, including not only what daily life was like for the family, but also the issues between Abby and her step-daughters. She shows what life was like in Fall River in the 1890s – industry, religion, the nationality/heritage of the people. She also talks about the role of women at the time, which undoubtedly had some bearing on the outcome of the trial. Throughout the trial, Robertson quotes both the transcripts and news reports.(As an aside, it is amazing some of the quotes regarding women, Lizzie and/or the crime: “there was something ‘effeminate’ about the hacking;” “‘if any girl can show you or me, or anybody else what could interest her up here for twenty minutes, I would like to have her do it’” (regarding the barn loft); and with regards to hysteria “in young married women, doctors initially claimed that hysterical symptoms resulted from a wandering womb.”)That amount of research that went in to this book was staggering. Except for a few places where I sensed a bit of bias, it is given in a very straight-forward matter. I can see how some people would view it as dry, as legal proceedings can be rather monotonous to even the interested parties. The multiple expert witnesses crossing (and recrossing) their T’s and dotting (and redotting) their I’s would make anyone’s eyes cross. I am used to reading caselaw and even I grew a bit bored. But this is the way trials proceed. Overall, this is a relatively complete telling of the entire story. I was particularly excited to see some information of which I was unaware: the existence of the original trial notes of ex-governor George Robinson, one of Lizzie’s attorneys.

Now at the farther reach of middle age, he shares his story as a late bloomer. From his vantage point at the center of the tech revolution in Silicon Valley, Karlgaard is well-placed to recognize the relevance of his experience as a late-bloomer.'Late Bloomers' is seamlessly written, highly readable and engaging. Karlgaard's personal testimony brings immediacy. His informed consideration of the dark side of extraordinary early bloomers is provocative and apt. So, too, he brings in the valuable experiences of various late bloomers.This book might be considered an exercise in practical pyschology. It may find a receptive audience in the corporate sector and anywhere else where identifying and developing talent is job one. So, too, it can be of value for parents and teachers, helping them recognize and serve young people who are developing on different timetables than those imposed by industrialized education.Perhaps most of all, this book can be of value for individuals who are seeking to elicit their best performance, even when out of sync with conventional expectations.

Having done that initial reading, I felt ready to read through the cookbook - and this is one that you really can read through.This is not what I would categorize as an \easy to cook from\"" book in that many of the recipes seem to call for ingredients that I need to plan buy, so to me that translates to being a good book for when you want to do a meal plan vs. when you're at the store and buy what looks good, then go home and look for recipes to match.

1524762091;The Universal Christ: How a Forgotten Reality Can Change Everything We See, Hope For, and Believe;R3EE3ZGCZY35IS;5;I feel like I have been waiting for this book for so long. It provides a well researched case — offered at the same time through the healing vision of a great spiritual teacher — that Christianity can be a religion and path that draws us into a much bigger, more expansive understanding of the divine mystery at the heart of all reality and within each of our own lives than what most of us inherited (at least this cradle Catholic!). It is filled with gems of both theological and practical wisdom for any spiritual seeker. The second half was where it really seems to take off.I deeply hope the message catches on, because there is so much here that can help provide a way out of the destructive divisions and groupthink that plagues our civic life today.

1524796379;Lost Roses: A Novel;R2YJYAQ3K705LV;5;I have not read Lilac Girls, but wanted to read this book because of the connection with the Romanov’s. The story takes place between 1914 and 1920 and follows two young women through the devastating days during the Russian revolution and the German conflict. Eliza Ferriday is traveling with her dear friend from her home in New York to her friend’s home in St. Petersburg where she hopes to visit some of Russia’s iconic landmarks. The friend, Sofya, is a cousin of the Romanov’s and Eliza has the honor of meeting the family during her visit. Eliza ends her visit when it becomes too dangerous to remain in Russia, but the friends exchange frequent written correspondence. When Sofya’s letters stop arriving, Eliza becomes worried and the scene unfolds among Eliza, Sofya and a nursemaid Varinka who’s hired to help care for Sofya’s young son. That ends up being a big mistake which results in the separation of mother and son. I really enjoyed this book. It was a bit long but the writing, the characters, the settings and the historical events made it fascinating and atmospheric. I love the cover and I look forward to reading the next book that dates back to the Civil War and features Eliza's grandmother (Caroline's great-grandmother).;Two friends – New York, Paris and St. Petersburg – Russian Revolution;Barbara McArthur;1556852262

I’ve been walking around trying to come up with my own band name...with no band members. But that’s besides the point. I blame my friend Kayla for picking this book up. I will admit that I was nervous because 1. It’s not my typical go to type of read. 2. I don’t usually like what others swear by. But I am so glad that I took the time and gave this book a try.I decided to listen to the audiobook because I felt like I would enjoy it more and I hit a solid on that one. I found myself at work engulfed in this world that Taylor Jenkins Reid created and I wasn’t mad at that.Daisy Jones & The Six hold such a special place in my heart. Set in the the 1960’s-1970’s, we experience multiple points of views as we enjoy this tell all book about the band. We learn how the band formed and we jump on the rollercoaster that is their ending.One thing that I loved about this book was how Taylor Jenkins Reid explores addiction in such a way that was poetic.I cannot gush enough good things about this book.

1524798622;Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel;R4AGFZR7T5VWC;4;"Daisy Jones and the Six is the story of the rise of a rock band as told by the members and those who knew them.  The story encompasses drugs, love and rock and roll in the 1970's.  The use of a documentary-interview narrative style made the story come alive.The characterization of a rock star is spot on.  If one is a child of the '70's or reads about that period, you immediately recognize this story.  This is the account of the \every band\"" of the 70's.I loved that the characters were flawed no matter how put together they appeared to be.  The depiction of each band member’s view of themselves and the band gave the reader insight into what makes a band succeed or fail.I highly recommend this book, it is well written with characters who come alive on the page.  The reader will root for them, cry with them and sometimes dislike them but no matter what, you are left feeling something.Thank you to #Netgalley and #BallentineBooks for approving my request.

1524798622;Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel;R3IEPO9CR0TP2O;5;I think this book is going to be a big hit. It is cleverly done in an interview type format and was very engaging, I read it all in one Saturday. Daisy Jones is a groupie in LA during the ‘70’s. She has a talent for writing songs and singing and wants to be a musician and not a groupie. The Six are an up and coming rock band and Daisy is who they need to become rock stars. Not everyone in the band is pleased to work with Daisy. They all have their own personal issues and Daisy is bright and talented, strong-willed but a train wreck due to her partying and drug use.Several times while reading this I kept wanting to go online and look these people up, they felt so real! I can’t believe the author was able to make this book so engrossing using the format that she did. I was really hooked and after I finished reading it, I watched Almost Famous, a movie I had not seen before but suddenly I really wanted too. The music in the book seems so real as well and the author has lyrics at the end for all the songs the “band” made with Daisy. There is a playlist to go with the book but I haven’t checked it out yet. I truly enjoyed this book and was so caught up in their world. I highly recommend this book. I’m going to go read the author’s previous work, she is so talented.;Very engaging, you’ll forget it isn’t real!;Grrrrrrll;1556620499
1524798622;Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel;RR3ORYPONY18G;5;"Daisy Jones and the Six is one of those extraordinary books that you never want to put down.  It is literary fiction, pop fiction, and chick lit all in one.  Interestingly, I think many men would enjoy it.  On the surface, it is the story of a 1970's pop band told in the manner of an oral history from the perspectives of the band members and the band's associates and families.The novel's two main protagonists are Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne, the band's primary singers and songwriters.  Daisy is a phenomenon, an 'it girl', the person every female in the world wants to be.  She is drop-dead gorgeous, ephemeral, and talented.  However, she feels empty inside and fills her emptiness with drugs and alcohol.  \It is like some of us are chasing after our nightmares the way other people chase dreams.\"" She is in love with a man who belongs to someone else and though they are drawn to one another, he will always do the good thing and never leave his wife.Billy Dunne is the self-described boss of the band.  His word goes.  Daisy both repels and attracts him and they are like two sides of a magnet that is spinning around - sometimes pulled together and sometimes pushed apart.  They can be in synch or go for weeks without talking.  This creates a lot of tension in the band.  Billy is in recovery and it takes all of his being to stay clean and sober one day at a time.  He is dealing \""with the push and pull of staying on the right path.  It was about sex and drugs and sex and love and denial and a whole mess of stuff.\""From a small garage-type band, Daisy Jones and the Six become an International sensation, creating songs that people want to sing and which almost everyone can relate to.  Daisy's charisma and Billy's songwriting are the band's primary strengths but it is also the times they are in, a time of free love, drugs, flower people, and folk rock.  The band began in 1969 and the book follows it through the 1970's.The story is rough knuckled and a thing of beauty.  The narrative is a song in itself, a Greek chorus of the times and a treasure for anyone who has the pleasure of reading this book.  In essence, it is about love.  \""Love is forgiveness and patience and faith and every once in a while, it's a gut punch.\""";Music and Love, Fire and Water;Bonnie Brody;1557144858
1524798622;Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel;R3CA6526MKXC4L;4;"Before I say anything else, I have to report that the cast and narration of the audio version of this title deserve five stars: including Jennifer Beals, Benjamin Bratt, Judy Greer and more, this cast was an absolute delight and I can not imagine having experienced this story any other way. I do have a physical copy, on loan from my library, and I looked at it a few times; I'm not a huge fan of this format, in writing, and I'm so thankful I chose the audio.I have loved ALL of the previous work Taylor Jenkins Reid has published; this certainly felt like a bit of a departure, and I admire her desire to branch out and try something new. This story, however, seemed rather redundant and predictable for the first 75-80%; truly, had it not been for the amazing narration, I might have given up long before what I considered to be its redemption point. With about 20% of the book remaining, I finally began to feel invested; I'm glad I stuck with it, for an interesting and unexpected twist.While I will continue to be a die-hard fan of the author, this will certainly not be on my list of favorites; as I mentioned earlier, I appreciate the unique concept and enjoyed the characters but, for me, the majority of the story was slow and unoriginal. The last 20% pushed me from 3 to 3.5 stars; rounding up for the fantastic audio production!";Not my favorite, but still a huge fan of her work!;Tara at Running 'n' Reading;1557162263

I always taught my students that it is never correct to follow a subject with a pronoun that refers to the subject.  Every chapter of this book had at least one, and often several examples of this mistake.  It is incorrect to write a sentence such as, \The President, he was upset and worried.\""  The \""he\"" is superfluous and should never be used.

While each novel can be read as a standalone, for me it worked better to read from the first book to date. I enjoyed seeing how Amos was growing as an FBI agent and as a man who suffered a head injury via the NFL. The series introduces Amos when he returns home in book one titled, Memory Man, to learn of the murders of his wife and daughter. From there, Amos spirals into a pit of darkness both professionally and in his personal life. What was really gripping in the latest novel was the way the author wove a mystery. Readers get a hint early as to who is the culprit only to learn…well, I won’t say so as not to ruin it for you who haven’t enjoyed it as of yet. The author has written a very engaging and riveting tale that kept me turning pages for hours. There were intricacies that made the story a surprise in the direction it takes and reveals a deeper plot than what is first apparent to the eye. Amos is changing since his appearance in book one and in many ways, he is also the same. There were a few heart touching-moments as I read parts that revealed Amos’s internal struggles and thoughts. Amos Decker is definitely a deep thinker. His personality quirks are at times frustrating to other characters but also endearing. I think readers will enjoy watching Amos Decker as he solves crimes, bucks the system and learns to live with loss. The series starts with Memory Man followed by The Last Mile, The Fix, The Fallen and now Redemption. Suspense, mystery, intrigue, and more fill the pages and will keep your nose in the book all the while engaging your mind as you try and solve the puzzle presented in each installment. I highly recommend starting at the beginning to really appreciate the character as he changes, grows and in some ways remains the Amos from the first book to the fifth.

1538761416;Redemption (Memory Man series);R2HUPPNF13MGHZ;5;I loved the previous four books in the memory man series. To me, this 5th book was a disappointment and not up to the usual Baldacci writing. Amos is back in his hometown of Ohio to visit his wife and daughter's graves. Once his partner, Jamison, leaves to return to the FBI, it is Amos and his old police partner trying to figure out a crime committed 10 years ago. The book added no new depth to the memory man, even when his friend Melvin Mars showed up, I felt he was very shallow and did not add much to the story. Much of the story line was spent summarizing Amos Decker, what happened to him and his family and why he is the way he is. I suppose that is necessary for the reader who is reading the memory man for the first time, but I found it distracting.

1538761416;Redemption (Memory Man series);R304IZEV2H4A2J;5;"Redemption is David Baldacci's latest offering in the Amos Decker series. This time out, Amos return to his hometown to visit his family's graves on his deceased daughter's birthday. He is approached by a recently released convict whom Decker had put away in his first rookie detective case. Meryl asks Decker to clear his name before he dies. Soon after, Meryl is found dead. As Decker and his former partner begin to investigate, more people start dying and although the local leadership as well as the FBI is not happy about Decker staying involved, he keeps at it and eventually uncovers not only a frame-up, but a decade long sinister operation that even the FBI finally acknowledges is worth their time.Amos is in his best form this time out, although the funky brain stuff with colors is muted. His memory is on full display, but his raw detective skills shine throughout. Amos's friend, Melvin also plays a significant role and he and Amos get to reprise an old football play. There are plenty of false leads and red herrings throughout as well as several plot twists. While there is much resolution, Baldacci leaves a bit unfinished to provide fodder for a future story.

1538761416;Redemption (Memory Man series);R1HUD1FMNWTW8T;5;I loved the previous four books in the memory man series. To me, this 5th book was a disappointment and not up to the usual Baldacci writing. Amos is back in his hometown of Ohio to visit his wife and daughter's graves. Once his partner, Jamison, leaves to return to the FBI, it is Amos and his old police partner trying to figure out a crime committed 10 years ago. The book added no new depth to the memory man, even when his friend Melvin Mars showed up, I felt he was very shallow and did not add much to the story. Much of the story line was spent summarizing Amos Decker, what happened to him and his family and why he is the way he is. I suppose that is necessary for the reader who is reading the memory man for the first time, but I found it distracting.

1538761416;Redemption (Memory Man series);R1OEHTGCMGOSD5;5;The Memory Man is back! Amos Decker is my favorite Baldacci protagonist. With all his quirks, he remains the most engaging and sympathetic of the author's many creations. He still has the prodigious memory, yet it seems that he's gradually becoming more humane, probably because of the many blows to the head that he keeps receiving in this series. The plot is prime Baldacci, a spider web of clues tenuously connected (red herrings abound) leading to a timely reveal. And again the author gives us the Bond-like villain spilling his guts at the end to bring everything full circle. A great, fun read!;Vintage Amos Decker;Sharon R -- A Regular Gal;1557379239

1541644980;Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment Is Killing America's Heartland;R1BEXA6STIEF0B;5;I've been struggling to answer this question for years and was hoping that HILLBILLY ELEGY would at least begin to answer that question and help me understand.  It didn't.  In contrast, I'm happy to say that Dr. Metzl writes a searing, intelligent analysis which encompasses a wide psychological and sociological grasp of people, places, politics, and positions.  Highly readable, I felt that finally someone gets it and helped me get it!Although I saw the author on television in the same interview many reviewers allude to, I'm particularly alarmed that someone reviewed this book without having read it.  Bizarre, but these are the times we're living in -- the age of being proud of one's own ignorance.

1541645634;Discrimination and Disparities;RL8ZOAHN63KS0;5;Once again Sowell has brought clarity to a contentious issue. Defining and categorizing the various types of discrimination is an absolute requirement if one professes to start an intellectually honest discussion. But as we know, that isn't why people bring up discrimination. They discuss discrimination and the resulting disparities only to receive transfer payments or for political advantage. Pity. This is a beautiful piece of objectivity and logic.

1541673549;The Case for Trump;R1B0ED02I6U5T5;5;"This is an important book but it is radically mistitled.  The title suggests that the book is a partisan argument on Trump's behalf.  'Making a case' suggests that the book will consist of special pleading.  That is not the case.  VDH is often characterized as a classicist and he is certainly a classicist.  He is also a cultural and military historian, as anyone who has read his most recent history book, THE SECOND WORLD WARS, can attest.  THE CASE FOR TRUMP is a history book, but it is, in effect, current history, and so it is journalism, but journalism done by a professional historian who operates, simultaneously, as a commentator on contemporary affairs and who, characteristically, puts contemporary issues in historical contexts.  He is generally described as a 'conservative', but readers should note that any commentator who is empirical by nature and open to all of the facts, not just those that are adduced to support, as we say, a given 'narrative' will often automatically be characterized as 'conservative' in current academic circles.  I prefer the term 'traditionalist' because my colleagues at the outset of my career in the 1960's were of various political stripes, many to the far left, but they were close to unanimous in their regard for reason, logic, hard facts and common sense.If the reader has been an assiduous reader/viewer of political events over the last several years there will not be a lot in this book that could be considered 'new'.  The book's strength (indeed, VDH's characteristic strength) lies in the orderly detailing of a multiplicity of facts to support an argument or flesh out a description.  Thus, e.g., we get an extended description and contextualization of the red state/blue state geographical divide, cultural divide, economic divide and, now, deep political divide.  We survey multiple examples of media bias and percentages of negative vs. positive coverage.  We examine important memes that have arisen among the commentariat (Trump would have lost to any other democrat; no other Republican could have defeated HRC.  Supporters take Trump seriously but not literally; opponents take him literally but not seriously . . . . ).The book's principal usefulness lies in the manner in which so much ground is covered and covered so clearly, succinctly and completely.  It is the sort of book that one would recommend to an individual who has not read/viewed events on a regular and intense basis.What is most interesting is its fundamental 'interpretation' or characterization of Trump.  VDH sees DJT as a classic, flawed hero, an individual who is needed in extreme circumstances but who is himself extreme in certain ways, the individual who is called on to clean house when no one else is up to the task and who will do so at great personal cost and who will then be forced to leave, either on horseback or feet first.  VDH offers the examples of Ajax and Achilles, but also, the example of Chris Adams in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, Will Kane in HIGH NOON and Alan Ladd's Shane.  Trump is Patton, not Bradley or Eisenhower.  My military colleagues at West Point spoke of these kinds of individuals, the sort who will volunteer for difficult and bloody missions at high personal cost; with a twinkle in their eyes they called them 'mission-oriented'.Thus, an account of the 2016 election and its aftermath is, in effect, military history and it carries all of the urgency attributed to it by Michael Anton.  We are likely to die if we rush the cockpit but we will surely die if we do not.Highly recommended.";"Radically Mistitled; This is Military History";Richard B.  Schwartz;1556804698

Amy Webb's The Big Nine brought these questions and answers into a clear and startling reality for me.

1601429568;The Way of the Warrior: An Ancient Path to Inner Peace;ROS3OTN87TKNG;5;"The book is about inner peace, which is the key in achieving spiritual wholeness. And the peace is achieved not by accident, but rather by artful intention. The author/pastor presents the intention through the ancient biblical practices, ultimately creating a story of a true warrior. What it means to be a warrior.The true warrior is the one who knows how to create peace. And the peace starts with your inner peace. What are the greatest enemies of our peace? Worry and fear. We also struggle against external forces such as: envy, greed, feelings, identity, and loneliness. The strength of peace is rooted in the present time, not the past and not the future.“You cannot control your circumstances, but you can control your character.”Peace is about clarity what is important to you. With this clarity there is no need to control the world around you.The warrior’s greatest weapon is wisdom. The key is to be open-minded, willing to change and grow. It’s about choices. “Decide what your life is about; decide what is worth living for, find your intention. (…) When you live your life with intention, you find your strength.”The indicator, if you’re on the right path, is the passion and energy. It’s about the process and not just the outcome.“The warrior must learn to walk with both humility and ambition.”The warrior must know his mind. The way you set your mind, that’s the way you will reap the fruits. If you believe in hope, love, future, that’s what you will find.The warrior owns his mistakes. The warrior takes responsibility for his life and his actions.The warrior knows what feeds his soul and always keeps doing it.The warrior has faith. You don’t run away from fear. You face it, and that’s when your faith will surface.“Only faith, hope, and love can give us the peace we seek and create the peace the world so desperately needs.”It is very clear that the author/pastor is not only a preacher of words, but also the one who has lived through those words. Therefore, making it a very profound read.This is the first book I’ve read by this author/pastor. So I’m not familiar with the messages from his other books, but what strikes me here is his wisdom.You don’t have to be a religious person to enlighten yourself with knowledge. You just need to be open-minded.";Enlightening Read;FB/BestHistoricalFiction;1557250224

1635570298;The Priory of the Orange Tree: THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER;RW27KDLZ6JOTE;4;I very much enjoyed the book, but then in the last few chapters started to feel like it was being rushed. We build to this big climax to face The Nameless One, but every character is rushing around doing stuff. At the beginning of the book we would have had a description of the travel and something would have happened. Late in the book someone sets out to a new land, we get two words about the journey and not much of note happens. Then suddenly the confrontation with The Nameless One happens.Good story, but it felt like the last bit was written under hard deadline, or to stay under a word count.

1635570298;The Priory of the Orange Tree: THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER;R2TM3FUQD6O48I;5;Samantha Shannon masterfully constructs a fantasy world underscoring many of the same issues important today -- feminism, religion and the dangers of fanaticism, distrust of outsiders, etc. Notably, the story takes place in a sophisticated, complex political climate, where there are not simple answers to everyone working together in harmony, ringing true to the globe today. Personal identity themes are also embedded throughout -- homosexuality, religion/skepticism, and the value of friendship to name a few. It's intriguing how much of society is matriarchal, allowing Shannon to explore a world where misogyny has not abounded for centuries. The story itself is very well interwoven between many characters and lands, and I found myself completely engrossed. You might feel a little confused and overwhelmed at the beginning because there are a lot of names and places to digest, but as you keep reading it all builds, connects, and becomes interwoven.I read a lot of fantasy, and would recommend this one as worth your time.;Richly-interwoven epic fantasy evincing present-day issues;Eric Suchyta;1556801909
1635570298;The Priory of the Orange Tree: THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER;R1ECHFSOZ9194I;5;"Epic Fantasy is always dicey when it comes to being 'epic'.  It has to be on a time-stretching, world-encompassing scale comprised of the culmination of a series of events that will crack the pillars of the society and decide the fates of all civilizations as it sweeps up folks from all known realms in its wake, a wake not all parties will survive and those that do are forever changed.Is this an Epic Fantasy?Yeah, baby!The story's told via shifting perspectives among four protagonists: Ead, a lady-in-waiting to the queen who's much more that she seems & whose tale drives the story.  Ead is a mage, a practitioner of forbidden magics & devotee of mysteries learned at the titular location- the Priory.  Though their mission is the same as that of most other nations- preparing for the inevitable return of the Nameless One- they see themselves as the true keepers of the faith that the western realms have warped & misunderstood.Arteloth Beck (Loth), a noble at Queen Sabran's court who's a lifelong friend to both her & Ead.  His sister, Margaret, and he have also been close friends with Ead since she arrived at court.  Those friendships place him in great political jepoardy.Tane, an initiate in House of Learning in the realm of Seiiki who becomes a dragonrider in the High Sea Guard.  We're introduced to her first and the decision she makes sets in motion events that will shake & shape the world to come.Niclays Roos, an alchemist & anatomist exiled from Inys to the east by Queen Sabran for betraying her trust and dreams of a way to return to court.  A not-so random encounter sets him on the path to do so, but at what cost?Samantha Shannon's world-building is staggering.  Like all great fantasy novels, a rich, sometimes too-detailed history breathes life into the various cultures of this world, based upon medieval European, Middle Eastern & Asian/Pacific cultures…  with a cursory nod towards African ones.  Just so ya know.  I suggest reading through the appendixes a couple of times before diving in.Even at over 800 pages (!), the pacing is good.  As an experienced author, Shannon moves things along pretty well; despite the level of detail and info-dumps involved there's not too many places you'll get bogged down in.  And you can always skim & catch up later.A universal theme in the story is equality; men & women serve in all capacities across all cultures, and same-sex relationships bear no stigma whatsoever.  I was struck by the implicit analogy between the dominant religion of the west- Virtudom- and Christianity.  Virtudom, as the name implies, is literally the principles of Knighthood that have been morphed from doctrines into dogma, with each Virtue embodied by a Duke sworn to uphold its tenets. The comparisons are readily apparent and unfold as the story progresses, as well as the ultimate mystery of how it all began and splintered from its origins, origins which the Priory and its allies still hold to.  There's also Virtudom's absolute security in their righteousness & their willingness to 'spread the gospel' to the infidels of the East, the Nameless One's similarities to Satan (including being bound for a thousand years), his minions doing his work in spreading fear & chaos across the world, corrupting world leaders from the true faith... and what happens when that faith becomes shaken and revealed for what it is- all interwoven into the fabric of the story.As there are only thirty-six plots, the details are what matters to any story.  It's not the destination, but the journey.  This journey isn't a family vacation; it's that road trip with your buddies where you get tattoos only your spouses are allowed to see and do legally questionable things in five different languages.  The intro with Tane starts small, almost incidentally, but Ead's sparks your interest and lays the foundation for things to come.But it's not all wine & roses (or beer & pizza, depending upon your tastes).  One key failing is in the side characters & romantic relationships.  After a while you can tell when the GoT-style moments are gonna happen where key figures need to be cut off from their support & safety nets to help drive their story arcs.  Kind of a cheap device when you can see who’s gonna get whacked, but in fairness there's a few I was expecting to go that didn't.The characters in the story really shine.  Ead, Tane, Nicklays & Loth are all complex individuals, shaped and motivated by their ambitions, faith, fears, darkness & dreams to see them through.  The secondary characters are no less developed, just secondary. Queen Sabran is someone you'll cheer for as you get to know her; I even had some empathy for Seyton Combe, the Duke of Courtesy aka the Night Hawk, spymaster of Inys. Igrain Crest, the Duchess of Justice, is also an intriguing figure as her story progressed. They're all not so much heroes and villains as they're people, which is what it's all about. And you'll enjoy getting to know them, even as you dislike some of them.Relationships between the characters is also a real strong point.  Some are familiar with each other, some casual acquaintances and others lifelong friends.  All four protagonists are organically connected in ways they both are and aren't aware of, helping to tie things together.  As far as romances go, there's sunshine over the rainbow for some and closure for others.  The only issue I have is with the lack of focus on any straight relationships. I’ve got nothing against LGBT relationships in my reading- the ones presented here are driving forces in the story- but a couple of straight ones to dive into would’ve been nice is all I’m saying.Word is that it’s a standalone novel, but it’s open-ended enough for a sequel and it completely deserves one.  I’d call that a PR move, because there’s no way this isn’t getting a second novel.  Too much is left unsaid, undone, unexplored & unresolved not to.The Priory of the Orange Tree is a fantastic novel that'll keep you up a few nights for 'just one more chapter'.  In this GoT era this one can sit on the shelf right beside GRRM's work.5/5 stars.";An Epic Fantasy for the Next Generation;John Green, NCGBT;1557148922
1635570298;The Priory of the Orange Tree: THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER;R8967NKPJ4GPX;5;If you thought Brandon Sanderson had a corner on standalone epic fantasy then you're in for a surprise with this one!As usual, let me start with the narrator.I've never listened to an audiobook read by Liyah Summers before, and after hearing this I can't understand why! She is absolutely one of the top talents in the business.She has impressive vocal range, giving us a wonderful assortment of voices, and even her male voices are widely varied and sound amazing! Her skill with accents is likewise incredible.She varies her pace to be a reflection of the events she's describing, which provides an excellent tempo throughout the book, and her vocal inflections are damn near perfect!Now, as the story begins there is a bit of a learning curve as we're dropped right in the middle of several different characters in different places doing different things and it does take a bit of time to acclimate to the nuances of each character and location.And I love it!One of my biggest complaints about so many fantasy novels is the over explaining. I don't need twelve minutes of exposition to explain the context behind the events you're about to describe. Just describe them and let me draw my own conclusion.Blessedly, there is very little to none of that in this book!Samantha Shannon has built a wonderful world here with deep, rich history (not all of which is known or true), complicated political atmospheres, fascinating mythology, and some startling revelations.At first, it seemed she had committed the (to my thinking) sin of making all dragons evil. But it turns out the world is a whole lot more complex than that.There is a part of me that's tempted to compare this book to A Game of Thrones, as there are definite similarities (largely in that court intrigue is a massive part of the story). There is a problem with drawing that comparison, however.In short, this book is better. Way better. In every way.The pointless, senseless brutality, vulgarity, violence, and sexual assault are absent. What brutality and vulgarity there is always serves a purpose.The storyline is way more concise, without the meandering and randomness.And frankly, the writing is just better. Orders of magnitude better.I can't say I'm entirely on board with the magic system, as I'm not overly fond of magic sources being external to the user (I have the same problem with GoT and many others). However, it is interesting.Elsewise, the closest thing I have to a criticism is the profusion of matriarchal cultures/societies. So far as I can tell, the world seems to have numerous matriarchies but only one patriarchy. And none that treat both gender with equal merit.Don't get me wrong, I don't think fantasy needs to be all about gender equality or anything, it just strikes me as a little odd that all these human societies are so strongly weighted toward female rule.In the end, whatever excites you about epic fantasy, you'll find it here.We have court intrigue galore, reversals, twists, secrets, and mysteries at every turn. We have deep, rich history, epic battles, phenomenal magical items, and genuinely heartfelt moments, both sweet and passionate.In short, this is the single best standalone fantasy I have ever read. You can't go wrong with this one.;In a word, WOW!;MasterTorian;1557282072
1683833988;The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook;R34M5ULH3A7LL3;5;"I've just received my copy in the mail so I haven't had much time to try out the recipes, but here's my two cents on this book. The quality of the book itself is very similar to the previous Fallout cookbook; the corner was slightly dented in shipping, but there's large, gorgeous photos of every recipe and some maps and artwork in the front and back. The pages are printed on a glossy quality paper, and there's some flavor text on every page as well. Here's some key differences between the two books:-First of all and most notably, the ingredients are much easier to find. There's no esoteric expensive foods in here, like lotus bulbs and bison meat. Overall you should have no trouble finding what you're looking for at the grocery store.-The recipes seem to cater toward newer chefs more. There's now multiple levels of how easy a recipe is to cook (instead of just Easy, Normal and Hard), and there's a small diagram to compare difficulty. Since the ingredients are easier to find it should also be simpler to get started, since there's a good chance you already have some of the food in your household. Don't fret if you're looking for a complex recipe that's large enough for a gathering, though; there's several delicious-looking meals like the Juniper Lamb Chops that look impressive and are sure to please your guests!-The foods lean toward hearty recipes such as stews, roasts, and dumplings. If you love savory food this is the book for you!As with the previous cookbook there's multiple different desserts, drinks and appetizers along with the main entrees. There's lots of clever nods to the game and you'll find recipes for foods like Kwama Egg Quiche, Water of Life, and Goatherd's Pie. No matter what your experience level is in the kitchen you should be able to find something you'll enjoy making in here. Overall I love this cookbook and I can't wait to start creating some of these meals!";Amazing cookbook!;Lindsey R.;1556574588

Xel is a strong character who feels very real and leans on his friends when he needs to but can hold his own...even if it takes some convincing that he is good enough to do so! There's also a nice bit of different types of representation in this book as well ranging from POC, WOC, LGBTQIA, and neurodivergent characters! The main character himself struggles with anxiety often and doesn't \magically\"" get over it by manning up or finding a magical plant or anything.The action and fight scenes are beautifully crafted with each character bringing their own unique fighting style and abilities to the stage, a real treat for those of us who are fans of the Legend of Korra and Avatar: the Last Airbender.If you're a fan of video games from Bioware, you will also enjoy how the characters interact and banter with each other. Along with how each character has their own \""quest\"" or side mission that they help Xel with.  Rynn has her specialty as does Wil and as does Char, so on and so forth.The ending is satisfying and leaves enough room for future installments (as the title does say Dargath Chronicles 1).

1945256737;Vegetables Illustrated: An Inspiring Guide with 700+ Kitchen-Tested Recipes;R15FYAR9J53BWF;5;This is a lovely book for a vegetable lover and for those who perhaps aren't crazy about them but wants to eat healthier and is looking for ways to make them attractive to eat. The recipes in this book motivate one to do so. The book covers a good variety of veggies, providing an introduction on how to select them, ways to prepare and other background info, before listing a good amount of recipes.  Some have commented about the lack of pictures/illustrations, and it is always good to have pics but given how thick the book is already I don't think adding a bunch more pics would be practical. There's a good amount of recipes for each vegetable covered in this book and it sure gives a lot of alternatives for livening things up instead of making them the same old way all the time.

And to think I was going to DNF it at ch. 10, but something about this book kept pulling me back to it. No matter how pissed off these characters made me, I couldn’t stop reading!!!!!!! There was just something about Hessa, that no matter how toxic you know they are for each other, you are still rooting for them the whole book. Then BAM! SLAP YOUR FACE, the ending. I know this book isn’t the best written wise or really story wise, but I LOVED it. As much as I HATE Hardin right now, he is who kept me invested in this story. And he is the reason I am about to pick up book 2 because I have to know what happens next!!!;The most frustrating, but somehow addicting book ever!!!!!!;Raven Dean;1557378691

1982111003;After (The After Series);R193O46T49RSXW;3;Tessa is a good girl with a clear direction for her future.  She is a little boring not daring.  She moves in to her dorm and meets Hardin.  Tessa has a boyfriend back home, and a controlling mother.  However she falls for the bad boy with a dark side and inside demons.  No matter how he treats her she always forgives him and they restart their relationship.  The book has potential and the story line is good but the angst and plots are too many.  In all the four books it is an ongoing of getting together, restart their relationship, stay together for a couple of weeks and then Hardin or Tessa doing something that comprises their relationship and it is a repeat.  I believe the angst is milked out too long in all four books.  I read the books.  I also omitted some paragraphs because they were a repeated theme in the book.  Both characters are strong and well developed but the maturity of the characters to develop takes too long.  Tessa is a doormat always forgiven Hardin however it takes a strong individual to forgive Hardin wrongdoing,  and to love him and see good.  Hardin behavior and demons coming to light is too slow.  However he tries to change for Tessa but when the change really take place it is too late.  This is the last book of the series when the change in Hardin happens.  In the last book there is a drastic change in both characters.  I really did not like that much the fourth book it moved too fast.  I believe the author did not give that much thought of what happens after Hardin demons are revealed.  The author failed in delivering a storyline in the fourth book. Both characters are separated for a good portion in the last book, and then it is fast forward towards the last few pages where they are together with kids.  I believe that the author failed to write about how to move forward in their relationship and to deliver a mature problem solving relationship.;Spoiler alert;London;1557269268
1982111003;After (The After Series);R23YP5636NVP0Y;5;Ok so I normally don't do book reviews!  But I have read most of the reviews for this book and I can honestly say that after reading this whole series it is not bad. I actually liked it. No I am not a One Direction  fan no wait that is not right I hear One Direction all day everyday. Let me clarify I have a teenage girl who is obsessively compulsively in love with One Direction so I know who they are and even know almost every word to almost every song. Don't judge! With that being said I first heard about this book when I found my daughter reading it on Wattpad. At first I was worried because lets be honest we all know what other book started on this site and I sure as hell absolutely did not want my daughter reading something like that. No I am not an uptight female with a stick up her butt. Yes, I have read that other book not to be mentioned! But what I read and what she reads is different.With that being said I asked her to give me 24 hours to read this book and then we would discuss weather or not she could read it. Within the first couple chapters of this book I thought oh great virgin girl dumb girl meets sexy bad boy. Yes, that does happen however, because this ends in a cliff hanger? I had to read the second to find out what happens and yes I hooked. Even though I thought this girl was the biggest pushover. I stuck threw the first two books and by the third I fell in love! Now yes this book started out as a fan fiction. But there is no mention of One Direction. In the end I really enjoyed the book and yes I allowed my daughter to read it because hey there is a lesson in this book. I know some of you are thinking why would let your daughter read this well for all of you that question it? Do you know what your teenage daughter or son are doing on the internet? I do !  Anna Todd thank you for this book because with this book I was allowed to show my daughter that not all relationships are sunshine and happiness.;But I have read most of the reviews for this book and I can honestly say that after reading this whole series it is not bad.

1982111003;After (The After Series);R1MEGR1UWW9BM7;4;This was my first book by Anna Todd. I've never read her stuff on Wattpad either. I guess I'd rate this book a 3.5/5 stars. This book was full of drama, some angst, love, and heartbreak. Did it need to be nearly 600 pages? Not really, but that's ok.Tessa- at the beginning she's a shy, sweet, studious, virginal, prim girl starting her freshman year of college. She's always followed the rules and did as she was told. Hardin (and friends) slowly break her out of her shell and she starts to become the woman she wants to be, rather than what others want her to be. I was happy to see her slowly begin to blossom into the woman she will become. There were times I wanted to shake some sense into her or give her some advice when it came to her naïveté, but I understand we all need to learn from mistakes. That said, would I have let Hardin treat me the way he did her repeatedly and then accept his apology? Hell no! But she clearly has a big, compassionate, forgiving heart and wants to understand and help him. I was pleased that she wouldn't just take his treatment though. She'd stand her ground and made sure Hardin knew what reason he was apologizing for, not just a generic apology. So good for her.Hardin- he's a player, a jerk, sexy with his tats and piercings, and honestly I'm not sure why I liked him, but there were times he was sweet and it drew the reader in and made us want to know what he was hiding. I wanted to nut punch him so many times for the way he treated Tessa and the story had me grinding my teeth. So Anna did good in making me feel. When we learn more about his history, it's when we really start to understand why he is the way he is. Still, I'd have a lot harder time accepting an apology for half the crap he would pull than Tessa did.All in all it was a good read. Yes, I'll be reading the next because I need to know what happens after how Anna let it end.;Roller-Coaster ride, but a good read.;xray_chick;1556749543

The book isn't all that great but it's not horrible either, as well as the fanfiction. It has a good story line and I love how it always got me thinking about what was going to happen with Tessa and Harden  although I admit that some situations between then were a bit repetitive at times but other than that I really enjoyed the story :) Hope the movie isn't a disappointment though""";people are not going to think of him as a horrible person that emotionally abuses his partner;Nadia;1556893268
1982111003;After (The After Series);R1PM8W6WIDRLC5;1;"This book has abuse apologist themes and the target audience are young girls, who will more than likely be swayed by this and come to believe that this behavior is acceptable. The victim ends up with her abuser, with all sins forgiven with no character development on the male’s part. The fact that an abuser is seen as the hero, and knight and shiny armor after Hardin stalks Tessa, mentally abuses her, and pushes her into sex, and more, is not something I can support. Not to mention, the writing is complete rubbish and this girl literally plagiarized Bronte and Hemingway quotes, word for word. This girl forgives her abuser time and time again despite his flaw, and some naive teenage girl is gonna read this and think it's okay, because that is what this shoddy series promotes at the end of the day.

1982111003;After (The After Series);R1YTAF51S5J0KH;5;Yes that is my rating. Instead of 5 trees, I give it an exploding tree rating. Why? You might ask. Let me just tell you that this story will make you explode from start to finish for many different reasons. Let me explain myself better, so as I sit here writing this review, my chest is still constricted from the crazy explosive emotions that I felt as I read the book and after I finished it (will talking about the ending later). It has stuck with me to the point that I can't think of anything else at the moment. The next book I begin to read after this one, should be afraid of my rejection. This book will give you all the feels but you won't require tissues, no, not even close, more like a Xanax and a support group.Like all my reviews I am super honest. So when I say that I almost quit this book about 20+ chapters in, I'm not exaggerating. I was struggling somewhat with the beginning and the fact that I was burnt out on contemporaries and Hardin was just UGH, annoying that I just wasn't connecting with him. I felt like OK, nerdy girl meets tattooed rebel, I've read this many many times before, so what is going to stand out. Then I did give the book a rest for 2 days, I didn't read anything at all for 2 days (I know, how did I survive that) to just clear out my mind of all 200+ books Ive read this year alone, I needed a clean slate. So when I pick After back up on Sunday night, I was already thinking this will probably be my last chance that I'll give it. Cue 6 hours later, its now 4am and I had to force myself to put the book down. I had to be up in 2 hours and knew I would be exhausted at wake up time. Then I did something I haven't done in a long long time, I had the book at my desk and kept sneaking a chapter here and there every moment I could. I was almost at the point like when Twilight, that I just stop everything and my sole focus was reading the book. I was almost there but being a Monday, my workload was crazy and I just couldn't check out. So throughout the day I read and read until finally I was down to the last chapter, then panic set in. I realized, crap, I am going to NEED book 2 like I need oxygen when I done.Little did I know, that that last chapter was going to wreck me completely, it wasn't that I just needed book 2 now, it was like I couldn't breathe from the shock of that ending and then knowing I was left with that ending till god knows when because I did not have book 2. Seriously if Anna Todd would have been standing in front of me when I finished After, I can't say if I would have kissed her or punched her. It could have been both, Todd girl, you are a genius!!!Now I can imagine the majority have heard of this story and its beginnings now. I for one did not have a clue that this story existed until Gallery Books sent the press release that they would be printing this Wattpad sensation. I am very familiar with fanfic, since I was a loyal follower of many now published books that began as Twilight fanfics such as Fifty Shades of Grey, Beautiful Bastard, Sempre, Wallbanger, ext... So I know how loyal the original followers can be when it comes to getting the word out about this story and its characters. I'll also admit, I really don't follow 1 Direction like most do. My heart still lies with the original boy band New Kids on the Block (someone write me a fanfic abut them please). So when I read this book, I wasn't picturing the band members of 1D, I didn't even look them up to put names with faces since in the published edited book, the names have been changed. I'm sure those billions of reads probably had a 90% 1D fan-base but I'm happy to tell you, I didn't pick this book up because of 1D, so to have fallen as hard for it as I did and not having to do at all because of 1D, ya know this book is Epic!Yes I know I'm rambling, that just shows you how effected I am by After. Seriously this will be the 2nd reviewed posted on OUaT for After, and if your not convinced after reading both of reviews, then I have no other idea how to convince you to read After. Maybe posting a 1D picture or even a NKOTB picture will do it, lol. Bribery is a good thing.Did that work? LOL! Well in case you still need a little more of a push, After is definitely not your typical contemporary as far as the romance and relationships involved. Even when it comes to Tessa and Hardin, you would never put those two together in any scenario but when they come together in After, explosions of a high degree happen that can range from toxic to out of this world. You will have a love-hate relationship with Hardin and at times want to slap Tessa so she can wake up. Then when they are on the same level, you will forget to breathe with their passion and words. I prefer Out-of-the-box then cookie cutter romances, and Todd delivers what I love flawlessly. That's it folks that is all your getting from me on After, I will not spill any more beans, you'll just have to read it for yourself (ASAP).Oh wait one last thing, remember I mentioned the ending. Yea, let's just say YOU WONT KNOW WHAT HIT YA!! Hardin is lucky he is a fictional character because if not, humph.

1982111003;After (The After Series);R22PMFJIJ8K8JK;5;This is the best series I have ever read!! I'm not much of a reader, but I seen this book was originally a Fan Fiction about Harry Styles, so I had to give it a go. I'm so glad I did because it's so good!! The only thing I would suggest is buying all the books together. I started reading the first book and loved it, so I got on Amazon to purchase the other four. I finished the first book a lot quicker than what I expected, because honestly I'm not much of a reader, so I drove an hour to get the rest of the series at Barnes and Noble.

1982111003;After (The After Series);R3P7U4AIDD8BTY;3;"Let me preface this by saying that fans of Beautiful Disaster will love this book. Having said that, I was not a fan of either of these books. (Sorry folks, just being honest here.) So, why did I read it then? Well, Simon & Schuster had sent me a paperback copy, and I picked it up without any prior knowledge of what the book was about or that is was fan fiction. Note: I am not against Fanfiction whatsoever.  I really enjoy going into a book without any preconceived notions.After is told from Tessa’s POV.  I really did enjoy Anna Todd’s writing, the detail of the scenes, as well as the pace of the book. However, this is a really LONG book with almost 600 pages.Tessa is starting her freshman year of college. She is smart, disciplined, conservative, organized, and a bit OCD. However, her boyfriend Noah is a year younger and a senior in high school. Cardigan-wearing Noah is very much like Tessa, and they have been friends since childhood and can’t imagine not being in each others lives.Once Tessa gets to college, she meets Hardin, who is the absolute opposite of everything Noah is. Hardin has multiple tattoos, body piercings, is a complete ass (85% of the time), and is extremely possessive of Tessa and who she talks to.  Keep in mind Hardin doesn't do relationships. Honestly, I was waiting for the big reveal that Hardin was bi-polar, but it never came.  I could have accepted his actions much better then.The story revolves around Tessa fighting her attraction to Hardin, leaving behind Noah, and of course disobeying her own mother by hanging out with Hardin and his other \trashy\"" friends.Honestly, this book felt like the movie “Groundhog Day.” Each chapter was basically a repeat of the previous chapter. Tessa getting pissed off by Hardin and his selfish and mean ways, saying she was done with him, but eventually she goes back to him. It happened time and time again.  I cannot tell you how many times I slammed by Kindle or rolled my eyes.I can’t even tell you how many times I said, “What the hell is she thinking?” At one point, Noah drove two hours to spend the weekend with Tessa at college. Hardin gets drunk off his ass and starts trashing his house, and Tessa comes to the rescue.  She left Noah without any hesitation, went to Hardin’s house, turned off her phone, and spent the night with him…all the while not caring one bit that Noah had no idea where she was. Who does that?While I am lost in my thoughts it finally seems okay for me to admit that listening to Hardin's steady breathing in my ear while he slept was worth never speaking to Noah again.\""These characters were 18 years old and freshmen in college. However, they lived and acted as if there were characters in their mid to late 20s…especially when it came to their sex lives. Did I mention that they had sex on Tessa’s desk while she was working as an intern? Really? Obviously, as a grown adult I think I would be an expert in this area, plus the fact that I have a daughter who is a freshman in college.Of course, there are the typical phrases that so many books have come to include: come for me, I want to see you when you come, you are mine, you are so tight, you are so wet and on and on and on.Yes, there were moments of Hardin being sweet, loving, attentive, and caring, but they were quickly overshadowed by him being a complete ass, regardless of what happened in his “past” to give him an excuse to act this way.\""Just because he can't love you the way you want him to doesn't mean he doesn't love you with everything he has.\""After will definitely keep your attention, and you won’t be able to put this book down. But it’s so frustrating, and I wanted to strangle Tessa for being so naive and stupid.  I will say it again, this book wasn't for me.Oh, by the way, After is the first in a trilogy, and there is a cliffhanger. You’ll have to wait until November 25, 2014, to read the follow-up novel, After We Collided.""";Hardin's Moodswings Gave Me Some Serious Whiplash;Michelle;1556804598

1982111003;After (The After Series);R30632A0NMWG8M;5;"Okay, this will be my first time ever reviewing a book but let me just say since it's AFTER, I have to.I am a Junior in college and when started reading this book, it was around September 2013, (Yes I remember) But before that, you will never catch me reading or anything for that matter let alone not putting it down 5 hours into it or in class when my professor is walking behind me. I honestly cared about nothing else.People talk about how the book is abusive or just about sex but that's what THEY want to see. The book spoke much more to me than that. And mind you, the book is no way abusive, Hardin might be the rude boy but what guy isn't rude majority of the time, Hardin's is just a little more extreme because of everything he faced growing up. You cannot just expect him to love everyone when he didn't even know what love was till he met Tessa.The thing that touched me most about the entire series are the quotes! Like literally! Anna was killing me with them. My favorite quote will be the one Liam told Tessa which states \Just because he doesn't love you the way you want him to doesn't mean he does not love you with all he has\""I apply everyday to my life! If her book doesn't nothing to you, my friend, you need help. And I love the fact that she didn't let Hardin change his whole personality for Tessa because we know you can't actually CHANGE someone.  But I love the fact at how she made it seem so realistic. Hardin tried and tried his best to be good for her. Sometimes he'll snap but that's just every human in the world.I really love this book and I am so proud of Anna. This book did to me what I never thought possible.

Tessa was sheltered her whole life and is a bit a prude. That will change rather quickly with her new friends. And there is Hardin. He is a mystery. He's hot and cold, fights with her and makes up. Is more than cruel and then nice enough.Tessa falls for him hook, line and sinker. Their chemistry is through the roof, but their relationship is toxic.And then the book ends with a firework and a major cliifhanger.Let me tell you, this book gutted me. I started reading and after some time I awaited the other shoe to drop. And o boy, did he drop. I promise you really really want to read this book. Don't miss out on it.This book has everything in it, a great story, wonderful writing and words I love. It has twists and turns, turns I never had expected. My jaw hit the flor and I was speechless.I really, really wanted to like Hardin, but he made it very difficult to.I can't say how much I love this book. The writing is brilliant and the story is great !I Highly recommend After- This Book is a Must Must Read !! I wish I could give more than 5 Stars and thank you Anna Todd !!;I Highly recommend After- This Book is a Must Must Read !!;KD;1557379684

1984817450;War of the Spark: Ravnica (Magic: The Gathering);R1M41FF1M0Q9KR;4;"I have been following MTG lore loosely since 2014 and very closely since 2015 (end of Tarkir block and into Origins and Battle for Zendikar). My gut-level reaction to this novel was similar to many of the 1- and 2-star reviews. It seemed like there was much that I didn't like and much to complain about. However, most of those negative feelings didn't hold up to scrutiny. Thus, my final review more generous than if I had written it last night.As a whole, I think that Weisman did a good job. The action, while fast-paced, made for an exciting read. I read from page 80-220 in one sitting because I was hungry for what would happen next. The personalities of the main cast was consistent with their Magic Story characterizations, and that's not always true from the Magic Story installments. There was emotional involvement with many of the characters and I genuinely cared about who lived/died. The plot twists would have been much better if the novel had been released before the card spoilers, but I knew the risks by following the daily spoilers.My only major complaint about Weisman's writing is that the pacing of the first ~100 pages was too fast. I think we needed another 50-100 pages of anticipating Bolas' arrival. The construction of the statue, pyramid, and obliteration of Jace's quarters happened a bit too quickly for my tastes (-1 star). There were things I would have done differently as well, like placing Gideon's after-life scene with as a first epilogue (the actual epilogue is then the second epilogue) and giving Bolas a more active role in battling the planeswalkers (though let's face it, if he was very active in the battle then the book would have been over in 50 pages).My biggest issue with the book had nothing to do with Weisman's writing. It has to do with the near-impervious plot armor that WOTC grants to major and minor characters. That may seem like a silly statement since an untold number of planeswalkers were murdered in this story. And that's exactly my point: red-shirt planeswalkers without names and total rando's in the streets were a vast majority of the casualties. There must have been over 50 named characters with a history in the MTG universe. They all fought in an epic battle with hordes of undead bests that could kill half of them by mere touch. You would think that the named characters were in terrible danger. In the end, only THREE of them died: Domri, Dack, and Gideon (even Bolas and his lieutenants were spared!). That's completely unrealistic, yet consistent with how WOTC handles their major/minor characters depicted on cards. I think only one minor character died in BFZ block (vs Eldrazi titans), only one major character in Shadows block (vs Eldrazi titan), and only three characters in this novel (vs Bolas' grand plan). This near-impenetrable plot armor removes nearly all of the tension from major conflicts. Bad stuff might happen, but both the heroes and the villains will likely survive. In order to tell better stories I think that WOTC must be willing to sacrifice some characters when the stakes are overwhelming. This story would have been more compelling if we lost more characters, like 1-2 guildmasters, 1-2 Ravnica personalities, and 4-5 minor planeswalkers (of which there were many to choose from).";Despite my initial reaction, this book isn't so bad.;Jonathan;1556603579
1984817450;War of the Spark: Ravnica (Magic: The Gathering);R2Q4XFT0FJZ2ZE;4;"Apparently, having the Magic the Gathering brand on your work is all it takes to get onto the New York Times Bestseller list, even when that work is a bunch of campaign callow drivel. The quality of writing in Greg Weisman's War of the Spark is something I would expect from a high school English class project. Characterization is shallow and uninspired, and if you've been keeping up with the MtG story, many characters will seem entirely off. The plot is essentially a single scene dragged out over 350+ pages, divided into countless chapters of just a couple pages. And each chapter swaps viewpoints from one character to another. There's no cohesion.Plus, I'm sure you all know that old adage about writing: show, don't tell. Unfortunately, Weisman loves to tell. He tells and tells and tells until you're sick of it. Every minor tidbit of backstory for most of the characters is sprawled out in rant-like paragraphs that feel tacked on to make franchise newcomers feel less alienated, but frankly are just frustrating to read for anyone remotely familiar with the lore.I thought I could get past the bad writing to enjoy the story that Magic has been building for years, but even that is difficult to do. As I mentioned, there isn't really a plot here, not in any traditional sense. There's no introduction, progression, and climax. It's just the climax. No buildup, no resolution. Like if the entire 3.5 hour Avengers: Endgame had been just the final battle and nothing else. And of course, if you're playing the card game, you already know most of the major plot points, including the result of the battle against Nicol Bolas. So really, there's nothing to be gained by reading this novel.Looking at Wiesman's previous work, it seems centered on comics. He might be very good at those, but his prose leaves everything to be desired. He very occasionally drops a neat gem of vocabulary, but overall he accomplishes none of the goals that fans should expect from this long-awaited return to proper Magic fiction.";NYT Bestseller does not mean it's good.;Jonathan;1557282751

Characterization is shallow and uninspired, and if you've been keeping up with the MtG story, many characters will seem entirely off. The plot is essentially a single scene dragged out over 350+ pages, divided into countless chapters of just a couple pages. And each chapter swaps viewpoints from one character to another. There's no cohesion.Plus, I'm sure you all know that old adage about writing: show, don't tell. Unfortunately, Weisman loves to tell. He tells and tells and tells until you're sick of it. Every minor tidbit of backstory for most of the characters is sprawled out in rant-like paragraphs that feel tacked on to make franchise newcomers feel less alienated, but frankly are just frustrating to read for anyone remotely familiar with the lore.I thought I could get past the bad writing to enjoy the story that Magic has been building for years, but even that is difficult to do. As I mentioned, there isn't really a plot here, not in any traditional sense. There's no introduction, progression, and climax. It's just the climax. No buildup, no resolution. Like if the entire 3.5 hour Avengers: Endgame had been just the final battle and nothing else. And of course, if you're playing the card game, you already know most of the major plot points, including the result of the battle against Nicol Bolas. So really, there's nothing to be gained by reading this novel.Looking at Wiesman's previous work, it seems centered on comics. He might be very good at those, but his prose leaves everything to be desired. He very occasionally drops a neat gem of vocabulary, but overall he accomplishes none of the goals that fans should expect from this long-awaited return to proper Magic fiction.";NYT Bestseller does not mean it's good.;Jonathan;1557284371

1984817450;War of the Spark: Ravnica (Magic: The Gathering);R3HBJXFM12FEKV;4;The writing matched one you would expect of a teenage vampire/werewolf novel. Our favorite characters felt flat and I suspect that was partly due to having to cram so many in the same novel. What's more is that several events happen off-screen which leaves the reader feeling disappointed at the portrayal of their planeswalkers they have grown to love (Vraska and Sorin/Nahiri for example). The dialogue from Nicol Bolas and Liliana felt especially flat with the former and whiny with the latter. Another character called Rat seemed like a convenient plot device/manic pixie dream girl. If you're invested into MTG than this book might be worth reading for plot continuation on several characters (Jace/Vraska, Chandra/Nissa, Ral, Dack), but if you're not I would skip this book.;Reads like a teenage soap opera;Jonathan;1556876326

My gut-level reaction to this novel was similar to many of the 1- and 2-star reviews. It seemed like there was much that I didn't like and much to complain about. However, most of those negative feelings didn't hold up to scrutiny. Thus, my final review more generous than if I had written it last night.As a whole, I think that Weisman did a good job. The action, while fast-paced, made for an exciting read. I read from page 80-220 in one sitting because I was hungry for what would happen next. The personalities of the main cast was consistent with their Magic Story characterizations, and that's not always true from the Magic Story installments. There was emotional involvement with many of the characters and I genuinely cared about who lived/died. The plot twists would have been much better if the novel had been released before the card spoilers, but I knew the risks by following the daily spoilers.My only major complaint about Weisman's writing is that the pacing of the first ~100 pages was too fast. I think we needed another 50-100 pages of anticipating Bolas' arrival. The construction of the statue, pyramid, and obliteration of Jace's quarters happened a bit too quickly for my tastes (-1 star). There were things I would have done differently as well, like placing Gideon's after-life scene with as a first epilogue (the actual epilogue is then the second epilogue) and giving Bolas a more active role in battling the planeswalkers (though let's face it, if he was very active in the battle then the book would have been over in 50 pages).My biggest issue with the book had nothing to do with Weisman's writing. It has to do with the near-impervious plot armor that WOTC grants to major and minor characters. That may seem like a silly statement since an untold number of planeswalkers were murdered in this story. And that's exactly my point: red-shirt planeswalkers without names and total rando's in the streets were a vast majority of the casualties. There must have been over 50 named characters with a history in the MTG universe. They all fought in an epic battle with hordes of undead bests that could kill half of them by mere touch. You would think that the named characters were in terrible danger. In the end, only THREE of them died: Domri, Dack, and Gideon (even Bolas and his lieutenants were spared!). That's completely unrealistic, yet consistent with how WOTC handles their major/minor characters depicted on cards. I think only one minor character died in BFZ block (vs Eldrazi titans), only one major character in Shadows block (vs Eldrazi titan), and only three characters in this novel (vs Bolas' grand plan). This near-impenetrable plot armor removes nearly all of the tension from major conflicts. Bad stuff might happen, but both the heroes and the villains will likely survive. In order to tell better stories I think that WOTC must be willing to sacrifice some characters when the stakes are overwhelming. This story would have been more compelling if we lost more characters, like 1-2 guildmasters, 1-2 Ravnica personalities, and 4-5 minor planeswalkers (of which there were many to choose from).";Despite my initial reaction, this book isn't so bad.;Jonathan;1556606459

In Sally Rooney’s sophomore book, two of these normal wannabes come from small town Carricklea—Marianne, a clever, quixotic, not very cool loner and Connell, the working-class popular kid whose mother cleans house for Marianne’s mother.The novel is a character study of the two, a dissection of the very meaning of love, an observation of how quickly things change and how difficult it is for things to come together. The reader can see that Marianne and Connell are good for each other but they keep getting in their own way with absurd quarrels and even more absurd other partners. Consider this line about Connell: “He and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them both.” The novel is filled with little gems like that, each succinctly revealing a little more about these (it appears) star-crossed lovers.As in her sublime Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney does not shy away from the truth of her characters or whitewash her scenes. Marianne willingly lets – even encourages – Connell to explore her body, only to sense his shame in letting his school chums know that they are “an item.” Marianne excels at Trinity College in Dublin where Connell is the quaint working-class scholarship caseAnd there continues to be a danse a deux – coming together, pulling apart, almost making it, crashing away, and on and on it goes.

Rooney's writing is so subtle and yet fearless, it is impossible to deny her powers of observation and delineation of character. Her skill at devising those characters is so deft that when the finale comes, a reader who has been so immersed, feels as if they know these people intimately, maybe even more so than the people themselves. Marianne and Connell personify the terrors of commitment. Despite their early connection of Connell's mum being Marianne's family housekeeper, they attend the same secondary school, where she is an outcast and he, a star. Their mutual attraction is so profound they deny it, keeping it a secret from his (supportive and loving) mother and her (abusive and sadistic) family. Advancing linearly, their Uni life and personal changes evolve over the course of a number of years as they come into their own, individually and together, personifying today's youth.;Perceptive and accurate;Rachel;1556618553

Her skill at devising those characters is so deft that when the finale comes, a reader who has been so immersed, feels as if they know these people intimately, maybe even more so than the people themselves. Marianne and Connell personify the terrors of commitment. Despite their early connection of Connell's mum being Marianne's family housekeeper, they attend the same secondary school, where she is an outcast and he, a star. Their mutual attraction is so profound they deny it, keeping it a secret from his (supportive and loving) mother and her (abusive and sadistic) family. Advancing linearly, their Uni life and personal changes evolve over the course of a number of years as they come into their own, individually and together, personifying today's youth.;Perceptive and accurate;Rachel;1556614713

1984822179;Normal People: A Novel;R3T74TRANITPN;5;"All the normal people—where do they all come from? In Sally Rooney’s sophomore book, two of these normal wannabes come from small town Carricklea—Marianne, a clever, quixotic, not very cool loner and Connell, the working-class popular kid whose mother cleans house for Marianne’s mother.The novel is a character study of the two, a dissection of the very meaning of love, an observation of how quickly things change and how difficult it is for things to come together. The reader can see that Marianne and Connell are good for each other but they keep getting in their own way with absurd quarrels and even more absurd other partners. Consider this line about Connell: “He and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them both.” The novel is filled with little gems like that, each succinctly revealing a little more about these (it appears) star-crossed lovers.As in her sublime Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney does not shy away from the truth of her characters or whitewash her scenes. Marianne willingly lets – even encourages – Connell to explore her body, only to sense his shame in letting his school chums know that they are “an item.” Marianne excels at Trinity College in Dublin where Connell is the quaint working-class scholarship caseAnd there continues to be a danse a deux – coming together, pulling apart, almost making it, crashing away, and on and on it goes. We root for these characters, we want them to be happy and we often sigh as they don’t see the forest for the trees.

This may be a book written for someone like me, I’m aware of that, but I can’t help but feel lucky to have stumbled upon it. The melancholy and intellect of the heroines allows me to identify as perceiving myself as an outsider while questioning the reality of my assumption. I’m reminded of didion or Salinger with how specific the tone is. I’m in.

1984898329;The Mister;R3SW0NFBJEVZGC;5;Okay this is going to be unpopular but I am not feeling it. The plot description was intriguing. The first 25% of the book had me going but then it just slow way down. The hero is not as alpha as I would have like – just many other talents an Earl, a photographer, a DJ and a composer sometimes. He does not like responsibility and living behind his brother’s shadow. He is a bit of a m*nwh*r* if all those condoms are any indication. The heroine Alessia is a young foreigner escaped a really bad situation. I like her – she is strong, resilient, humble, and a survivor. She is a maid cleaning Maxim’s home. A damsel in distress and Maxim to the rescue. He is super protective and caring with her. It is all very sweet. I was expecting a bit more explosive first sexual encounter but it was a bit underwhelming for me a lot of “ah”. I guess this storyline is not my cup of tea – a virgin promised to another man, got kidnap, sold, human trafficking. The hero is way rich and powerful fell in love with her beauty and innocent and sweep her off her feet to the sunset. The bit about the brother ex- their behavior I did not agree with no matter how much one grief. In the end though I did like Maxim more for his kindness and the unconditional love he has for Alessia. He changed for the better for her. Don’t love it, don’t hate it! Just okay for me.;Don’t love it, don’t hate it! Just okay for me.;The Guide To Romance Novels;1556548165

1984898329;The Mister;R13W8TG7O3QULC;5;"4 Stars!Before I begin my actual review, I have two major issues with the way readers are reviewing this book:1) I don’t agree with those claiming that EL James is a terrible writer. I would love to know what literary genius these people are reading in the ROMANCE genre on the regular. Seriously. I have read some romance authors who do write better than James, but I have read and DNF’d a TON of garbage romance writers. What I personally enjoy about James’ writing, is that it’s fast paced and very heavily focused on the hero/heroine relationship building. There isn’t a lot of other “fluff.” One of my biggest pet peeves is when I’m like 60% of the way through a book and the hero/heroine have yet to really build any time of legit relationship. Talk about a snooze fest.....I think the major issue here is jealousy, but what do I know.2) Half the readers are complaining it’s too much like Fifty, and half are complaining it’s too different....I don’t honestly know what to say about these people. Let’s review the actual book called The Mister, m’kay?The Mister contains one of my all time favorite tropes: rags to riches for the heroine and a major gap in social class between the hero and heroine. Call me sexist but I love it. It’s such a fantasy. Who wouldn’t want to be swept away by some gorgeous royal? I know I wouldn’t mind one bit. Alessia, our heroine, is a cleaner who finds herself cleaning the house of Maxim Traveleyan. Maxim is wealthy, he’s royalty, he’s a little broken when they first meet and he’s perfect for Alessia.Their connection is fast, it’s convincing, it’s consuming, and it’s sexy. Alessia’s background is dark and so we have a bit of a damsel in distress storyline as well. YES PLEASE!One thing I loooooved about the story is that James infuses some references to classical music since Alessia plays the piano quite well. It was a refreshing subplot. I really enjoyed pulling up the classical pieces on my iPhone, listening to them, imagining them as background music for the scene and trying to figure out why that particular piece was chosen. It made the storyline much richer!The last 20% of the book is quite suspenseful and I found myself racing through the pages. I wish I had slowed down a bit to really enjoy it. I was too eager to finish. That being said, I think the one thing keeping me from rating the book higher, is that James played it too safe with the darker elements of this book. I think she could have really pushed the elements further than she did. I almost wanted more violence, more running, more evil. It would have made the resolution all the more satisfying in my opinion. But I’m a little twisted so....there’s that.Otherwise, I’m deeply satisfied with The Mister and hope for more from James soon!";Enjoyed it!;The Guide To Romance Novels;1556547586

045149086X;When We Left Cuba;R3LTZHR4RM02N0;5;"While I almost always avoid political commentary of any kind in my reviews, there are times when it is really hard. Please accept my apologies in advance if I cross the line with this one! Chanel Cleeton has written a fascinating sequel to her book Next Year in Havana which introduces us to the Perez family and the island of Cuba during the years of unrest, revolt, and the subsequent takeover by Fidel Castro. When We Left Cuba is the story of Beatriz Perez whom we met briefly in the first book, kind of a teaser for this complex woman born out of time into a world where women were almost like children – present to be seen and not heard. She is a character who loves her Cuba and her family deeply and who refuses to be shoved into the mold dictated by her heritage and the fact that she is a woman. She is a character who will stick with you and through whose idealistic, but nevertheless jaded eyes you will see how easy it is for political activism and revolution to go terribly awry; there is a very good reason why there are so many cliches about the corrupting effects of power. She is also a character who is flawed. She desires revenge at any cost and the love of a man who seems out of her reach. Whether you see Beatriz as courageous or foolish, you will be awed by the lengths to which she will go during a time when courage and resourcefulness were not desirable qualities in a woman.Chanel Cleeton  impressed me with Next Year in Havana which I listened to on audio and reviewed. It was rich in historical detail, and the past and present timelines gave it an almost dreamlike quality. When We Left Cuba has a very different feel. While it still has the historical detail, it is very much Beatriz's story and gives the reader a clear vision of the events surrounding the Cuban Revolution through the eyes of a complex and captivating character. Readers will be able to envision the contrast between the Cuba that was, the Cuba that was hoped for, and the Cuba that exists today. To those who want to toy with our precious democracy, I say \Look at Cuba and be careful what you wish for.\""";Fascinating Sequel to Next Year in Havana!;Rachel M;1556749630
045149086X;When We Left Cuba;R26TL89KKZ22RD;5;The Perez family have escaped the revolution to live in Florida and make a new life. But all daughter Beatriz, who has no interest in the debutant scene and who is mourning the death of her twin brother at the hands of Fidel Castro’s supporters, wants is to return to Cuba. When the CIA offers her the opportunity to avenge her brother’s death and help overthrow the revolution by killing Castro, she cannot resist, but what she didn’t count on was falling in love with an American senator who offers her an alternative life. Set among the glamour and danger of the Kennedy years, When We Left Cuba is an excellent follow up to Next Year in Havana.;An excellent follow up to Next Year in Havana;Rachel M;1556857257

I love the historical fiction by Laura Kamoie (co-written with Stephanie Dray), so I wasn’t surprised that I adored the book she recommended, When We Left Cuba by Chanel Cleeton.The heroine of this novel, Beatriz Perez, is that rare woman in fiction who has a larger agenda in life than just falling in love, getting married, and raising a family. Fall in love she does, but the rest of it? Beatriz is determined to go her own way.This is a passionate love story played out against the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis, Fidel Castro’s rise in Cuba, and the power struggle between the US and then-Soviet Union. Beatriz is a beautiful ex-patriated Cuban living in Florida with her formerly wealthy family. Her mother’s only wish is for Beatriz to marry. Beatriz wants only to avenge her twin brother’s murder by killing Fidel Castro.We know from history that Beatriz Perez did not kill Fidel Castro, but her efforts to do so in this story are nonetheless nerve-wracking and action-packed. Equally nerve-wracking, from my point of view, is Beatriz’ inner struggle to choose between the man she loves and living the life she feels she was meant to live.Interesting for me, too, to read about that tumultuous era in history, when I was a fourth grader in Arizona and largely oblivious to the events of the day.All in all, a great read!";Fascinating story of a larger-than-life heroine;Rachel M;1556890724

045149086X;When We Left Cuba;RU6EZNSVNJMTX;5;"#partner Thank you @Berkleypub for this free copy to review.I have learned so much about Cuba's history during this time frame from Chanel Cleeton's two books. In her novels, she presents multiple facets of the revolution, how it changed Cuba, what it meant for those that fled the island and for those that remained. By placing Beatriz in a world of espionage, the reader gets to examine all the players in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The novel is historical fiction and romance combined, and while I may not have liked all Beatriz's decisions, she was a strong, intriguing character. I felt as though the author perfect captured the atmosphere of the early 1960's, the optimism of the Camelot years and the dark workings of the CIA in the background. And while this could be read as a stand alone novel, I think its beneficial to have read Next Year in Havana first, so as to have the full scope of Cuba's revolution in mind when you start this novel.";Castro, Kennedy, Khrushchev, Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis.;Rachel M;1557354391

This is Christian fiction at its finest. There are some really hilarious parts that made me laugh out loud. There are some truly touching parts that brought me to tears.

047339653X;Then There Was You;R1RYCW5YU3EA2K;5;"From the very first page of Then There Was You, I was chuckling. It didn’t take long to outright laugh aloud. I adore Kara Isaac’s writing voice. It’s full of warmth, humor, sincerity, and emotion. Josh and Paige are endearingly flawed with their own stories that color their assumptions about each other when they first meet. This not only serves as a gentle reminder for all of us to look past first impressions and/or prejudices but also makes for some excellent banter between these two characters.Speaking of banter, the romance in Then There Was You is swoony and fun and heartfelt – and full of moments where you forget to breathe because you’re so caught up in the chemistry playing out on the page. Josh? Hello. He’s hot, he loves Jesus, he’s a musician, he’s adorably grumpy at times and HE HAS AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT! Need I say more? Paige is adorable in every way – approachable, feisty and unintentionally quirky. Her friendship with her brother is deeply touching, and I keenly felt Paige’s emotions when she thinks about Ethan.Another something I really appreciated about this novel is the care given to both the Australian and American vocabularies. We, of course, speak English in both places but the language does have its subtle (and not so subtle) differences, and Kara Isaac does a great job at including these differences without making an issue of it. Of course, now I’m making an issue of it (lol) but I find it rare in novels that I read. Probably my favorite example of this is the scene where Josh and Paige are eating lunch at the mall’s food court. When we’re seeing Josh’s perspective, Paige dips her chips in tomato sauce. When we switch back to Paige’s head, Josh steals a fry and puts it in ketchup. It’s little details like this scattered throughout a novel that take it from ‘good’ to truly great.Bottom Line: From the sassy banter, the laugh-out-loud humor, and the breath-stealing romance to the sincere emotion and poignant spiritual insight, Then There Was You is delightful on all levels. It also contains one of my very favorite declaration scenes of all time. (I’ve read that section more than once. Don’t judge.)

047339653X;Then There Was You;R3GZV28KRR8FV;5;"Where do I even start?! This book was amazing! Truly! I’m not just saying that because I love this author’s work, though there is that, but because I really did love it! I had such high expectations for this book and Ms. Isaac surpassed them all! I’m not always a big fan of contemporary romance, though I do have a few authors whose books I will excitedly snatch up at the bookstore and Kara Isaac has quickly had her name added to the list. I enjoyed her first two books, “Close to You” and “Can’t Help Falling,” but I can honestly say that this self-published novel is probably my favorite of hers! Before the “self-published” part puts you off, this book has been carefully edited and is beautifully written. If you’re like me and can’t stand typos or have seen some of the more “unique” self-published books, never fear! I don’t believe I could have enjoyed this book more, unless I could have traveled to Australia myself! As always, I loved Ms. Isaac’s writing! She drew me in from the very first sentence and I couldn’t resist stepping into this adventure with Paige. I enjoyed every awkward and laugh-out-loud moment, mixed in with the sweet and sigh-worthy ones. I loved getting to see Sydney, Australia through the eyes of an American like myself, as well as through Josh’s eyes. Ms. Isaac definitely hit her stride with this story, writing about something she obviously knows well (or maybe that’s lots of research) and introducing me to a place I’ve often dreamt of visiting. I appreciated the flubs and mistakes Paige makes along the way, while also laughing with Josh, because I could see myself doing the exact same thing. The dialogue is also great! I adored the inside jokes and even the misunderstandings. Also, Josh’s accent . . . can we just take a moment to appreciate Australian accents? Because I love hearing them and I could almost “hear” his accent while I was reading. That was “maybe” the best part for me . . . okay, not really. But a definite perk! I’ve already commented that Paige McAllister makes a few mistakes . . . she might be considered a walking disaster now and then, though she tries really hard! And I absolutely adored her! She is a lady I could totally see myself being friends with and I cheered her on the whole way! I loved her strength, her determination to face the hard things, her ability to laugh at herself, and how realistic she is. She struggles in this story. She falls down and has to work to get back up. She has some prejudice she has to work through, and decisions to make and I loved walking beside her through those things. And laughing about the “drop bears.” Josh Tyler is an interesting hero. In a good way. He’s different. He comes off as a bit self-righteous at first and it’s apparent he could use an attitude adjustment, but despite that, I still liked him. I appreciated seeing Paige and his home country through his eyes. And I enjoyed getting to know him and learning why he behaves the way he does. His life isn’t perfect. He’s made mistakes and the regrets still follow him, coloring every decision, every conclusion. I loved his family and the way they don’t take any of his guff, but give it right back. Especially his sister. I really hope she has her own story at some point (hint, hint)! And I do have to mention that he definitely redeems himself at the end. Such a good ending! Overall, I give this book a standing ovation and beg for an encore!My thanks to the author for my advanced copy of this book!

047339653X;Then There Was You;R8YJ71BU1VEOZ;5;"From the very first page of Then There Was You, I was chuckling. It didn’t take long to outright laugh aloud. I adore Kara Isaac’s writing voice. It’s full of warmth, humor, sincerity, and emotion. Josh and Paige are endearingly flawed with their own stories that color their assumptions about each other when they first meet. This not only serves as a gentle reminder for all of us to look past first impressions and/or prejudices but also makes for some excellent banter between these two characters.Speaking of banter, the romance in Then There Was You is swoony and fun and heartfelt – and full of moments where you forget to breathe because you’re so caught up in the chemistry playing out on the page. Josh? Hello. He’s hot, he loves Jesus, he’s a musician, he’s adorably grumpy at times and HE HAS AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT! Need I say more? Paige is adorable in every way – approachable, feisty and unintentionally quirky. Her friendship with her brother is deeply touching, and I keenly felt Paige’s emotions when she thinks about Ethan.Another something I really appreciated about this novel is the care given to both the Australian and American vocabularies. We, of course, speak English in both places but the language does have its subtle (and not so subtle) differences, and Kara Isaac does a great job at including these differences without making an issue of it. Of course, now I’m making an issue of it (lol) but I find it rare in novels that I read. Probably my favorite example of this is the scene where Josh and Paige are eating lunch at the mall’s food court. When we’re seeing Josh’s perspective, Paige dips her chips in tomato sauce. When we switch back to Paige’s head, Josh steals a fry and puts it in ketchup. It’s little details like this scattered throughout a novel that take it from ‘good’ to truly great.Bottom Line: From the sassy banter, the laugh-out-loud humor, and the breath-stealing romance to the sincere emotion and poignant spiritual insight, Then There Was You is delightful on all levels. It also contains one of my very favorite declaration scenes of all time. (I’ve read that section more than once. Don’t judge.)

047339653X;Then There Was You;R1BCOS1R7LSNOO;5;"Where do I even start?! This book was amazing! Truly! I’m not just saying that because I love this author’s work, though there is that, but because I really did love it! I had such high expectations for this book and Ms. Isaac surpassed them all! I’m not always a big fan of contemporary romance, though I do have a few authors whose books I will excitedly snatch up at the bookstore and Kara Isaac has quickly had her name added to the list. I enjoyed her first two books, “Close to You” and “Can’t Help Falling,” but I can honestly say that this self-published novel is probably my favorite of hers! Before the “self-published” part puts you off, this book has been carefully edited and is beautifully written. If you’re like me and can’t stand typos or have seen some of the more “unique” self-published books, never fear! I don’t believe I could have enjoyed this book more, unless I could have traveled to Australia myself! As always, I loved Ms. Isaac’s writing! She drew me in from the very first sentence and I couldn’t resist stepping into this adventure with Paige. I enjoyed every awkward and laugh-out-loud moment, mixed in with the sweet and sigh-worthy ones. I loved getting to see Sydney, Australia through the eyes of an American like myself, as well as through Josh’s eyes. Ms. Isaac definitely hit her stride with this story, writing about something she obviously knows well (or maybe that’s lots of research) and introducing me to a place I’ve often dreamt of visiting. I appreciated the flubs and mistakes Paige makes along the way, while also laughing with Josh, because I could see myself doing the exact same thing. The dialogue is also great! I adored the inside jokes and even the misunderstandings. Also, Josh’s accent . . . can we just take a moment to appreciate Australian accents? Because I love hearing them and I could almost “hear” his accent while I was reading. That was “maybe” the best part for me . . . okay, not really. But a definite perk! I’ve already commented that Paige McAllister makes a few mistakes . . . she might be considered a walking disaster now and then, though she tries really hard! And I absolutely adored her! She is a lady I could totally see myself being friends with and I cheered her on the whole way! I loved her strength, her determination to face the hard things, her ability to laugh at herself, and how realistic she is. She struggles in this story. She falls down and has to work to get back up. She has some prejudice she has to work through, and decisions to make and I loved walking beside her through those things. And laughing about the “drop bears.” Josh Tyler is an interesting hero. In a good way. He’s different. He comes off as a bit self-righteous at first and it’s apparent he could use an attitude adjustment, but despite that, I still liked him. I appreciated seeing Paige and his home country through his eyes. And I enjoyed getting to know him and learning why he behaves the way he does. His life isn’t perfect. He’s made mistakes and the regrets still follow him, coloring every decision, every conclusion. I loved his family and the way they don’t take any of his guff, but give it right back. Especially his sister. I really hope she has her own story at some point (hint, hint)! And I do have to mention that he definitely redeems himself at the end. Such a good ending! Overall, I give this book a standing ovation and beg for an encore!My thanks to the author for my advanced copy of this book!

125012610X;Sunset Beach: A Novel;R1OIW7PMHFEZ9J;5;Sunset Beach by Mary Kay Andrews is one of those books that you start reading and can’t put down. What more could you want - you are at the beach but there is a mystery to solve and relationships to repair? Drue is at the lowest point in her life. She has just lost her mother, still recovering from an injury and has no place to go. Her estranged father shows up and offers her a life line - a job and a forgotten family beach home. Drue becomes entwined in two very different mysteries one from the past and one from the present. She is trying to get to the truth even if it involves her family. A Mary Kay Andrews novel is like a hot Krispy Kreme doughnut you can’t resist it. I received a copy from netgalley. I was very happy since I have read several of Mary Kay Andrews books and have loved every one. If you like mysteries with a beach setting and interesting characters you will like this one.;Another great beach read;Patsy S.;1557290522

The story was well written, the characters were believable and it was good because it was definitely not your typical love story!""";Not your typical love story;Suzanne Simonetti;1557288700

It’s been a long time since I read a Wimpy Kid book, but I do remember how Greg was always busting on Rowley. However, seeing it from Rowley’s perspective REALLY changes the narrative. Greg is the epitome of bad friend and mercilessly bullies Rowley. Is Jeff Kinney trying to kill the series? If so, this may very well do it.

Thanks to NetGalley and Ten Speed Press for the opportunity to read and review The Book of Greens by Jenn Louis! The Book of Greens begins with a complete recipe list of vegetarian dishes, starters and snacks, salads and sides, soups; pastas, grains and dumplings ; fish and seafood; meaty mains; and drinks and sweets that are included in the book. Sections such as The Basics and How To Use This Book help get the most out of your greens. The section, Types of Greens in this book, lists the type, best method of cooking and specific greens to use in the recipes. A Seasonal Chart helps the reader know when certain greens will most likely be found for purchase. Bowls 101 shares four rules that will help in making great salads. The rules are \not all ingredients go together";" \"" don't bog down your base green";"less is more. There is also a rule for three components for a delicious bowl: flavor, texture and visual appeal. The system to make a delicious dish with greens follows these steps: 1-choose a base (type of green) 2-add variety (add veggies, fruit), 3-add texture (grains, nuts, popped corn, seeds or bread crumbs), 4-add protein (hard-boiled egg, cooked meat, beans), 5-add saltiness, 6- smooth it out with herbs, 7- sharpen it up and 8-dress it. Very detailed, color photos and an enormous selection of greens and the recipes to go with them. 5 stars.""";The Book of Greens

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R15ANWONS5NLKP;5;"Trade paperback 2018The \Gallery book 2002\"" info that the product URL cites is in reference to a popart \""comic book style\"" cover-art that didn't do any favors regarding capturing the appeal of the book visually.  The movie this book's author wrote was a by the numbers dry as paint stupid MOFO adaptation.  So what's left?  That stupid hardcover dust jacket that Doubleday haphazardly slapped onto the initial pressings of the book and the subsequent mass market paperback edition?  A respectful hardcover re-issue, put together as part of a set of some of his books sometime in the early 1990s, is almost impossible to find.  There was a so-so trade paperback released in England a few years ago with a really stupid tagline.This book deserves a good cover.  It's one of those books that's really really really really really GOOD.  It's not something God himself would want to read.  It's probably not something you yourself would want to make a religion based upon or apply to your life philosophy.  Stephen King wrote this book and disowns it because it isn't \""truthful\"" enough.  Who cares?  Stephen King ain't anyone to talk authoratiatively about the truth.  His lesbian daughter preaches the gospel for a living.  Apparently having one's head up their butt runs in the family.  This book strikes at the heart of man.  The heart of man is deceitful above all things --- and exceedingly wicked.  We don't need Stephen King to deliver us from that.  Some people don't even want to be delivered from that.  Sometimes you can't escape it.  This book isn't THE TRUTH.  But it does speak to the true hearts of real people for better or worse.  And it does so in a manner far more effective than most of his horror novels ever did.  CARRIE was not the POS that he initially thought it to be when he set out to write it before giving up on it, but it wasn't half as nerverattling as this.  'SALEM'S LOT, THE SHINING and CUJO et al were well and good, but this is the granddaddy of them all.  I'm not buying it until I can get it with a decent cover.  I tried ordering it after Amazon.com updated the stock photo and they sent me the old one with the popart cover.  I guess they still had some of them leftover.  This cover-art is the same as the mass market paperback edition issued in February 2017, but I'm not going to pay $9+ so I can \""proudly own\"" this book in some pulp novel format.  It'd be one thing if I just didn't have room for it, but unlike my CD collection that is easier to use because its' not vinyl, a trade paperback is every bit as useful as a mass market paperback.  The pages are no more flimsy or cumbersome than a mass market and it just freakin' looks better.  And a hardcover reissue that doesn't cost $50++ doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.  IT (1986) -- also one of S.K.'s superior works -- did finally get a hardcover reissue, but not only was the cover rather pathetic, but it had that stupid promo quip \""NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE\""  Since the makers of this past summer's re-make of the movie IT are apparently planning to also remake PET SEMATARY (about dang time!), we might get an equally lame hardcover edition of this book finally -- or maybe it'll be a quality hardcover pressing, i.e.: the mistakes of the past are not repeated (it could happen).Perhaps someone who doesn't feel the need to 'I would tell you, but you're not worthy....\"" will point me to a place on the www where I can find a copy that I can afford(?)""";Amazon 2018 trade ppbk edition misfire;Jonathan Cardwell;1556574222

After discussion from readers who read the book in varying formats, the consensus was unifying: read, don't listen. With a story that relies on suspense, reading at a pace that fits the scene is important to holding interest. Relying on the narrator's pace resulted in the story having an extremely slow start, and the suspense was lacking - these were problems that print readers were surprised to hear.When it comes to comparison to the movie, we found that the book offered much more to Danny's clairvoyance, but all agree that Jack Nicholson's portrayal was spot-on.

This book is the best horror I've read so far, and is one of my all-time favorite books in general.\""Pet Sematary\"" is, actually, more of a frightening tragedy than a work of true horror";" its simple structure and small set of characters recall something like \""Frankenstein\"" where a troubled man tries to tamper with powers beyond his control.  The Creed family (Louis, his wife and their two children) move to rural Maine so Louis can take over as hospital administrator at MSU";" the family quickly becomes close with the elderly, childless couple next door, the Crandalls.  After an exposition that gives subtly drawn insights into the characters, King begins slowly and methodically turning up the heat while deepening our attachment to the characters.  We're so involved with Louis, especially through King's superb evocation of his utter grief at the half way point of the book, that we pray that the story won't go where we know that it will.Stephen King is a very gifted writer who has tremendous respect for his characters, who are ordinary people put in extraordinary situations.  At the end of the book, King could have gone easy on us, but instead he takes the psychological chills that have grown over the course of the story (Jud's story in the second section, the change in the family cat, Louis's overwhelming grief, his wife's fear of death, etc, etc) and pulls out all the stops to a completely terrifying, tragic end to the story.Just like many great tragedies, Louis's decision brings suffering and heartbreak to all of those close to him, not just to himself.  The story is a moving, tragic, terrifying fable for the line that we can't cross."""

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R1JTUWG24CFE0N;4;This is one of those popularized works that is hard to read without imagining the characters created within Stanley Kubrick's reimagining of the Shining - assuming you've seen it, of course. In spite of having one's vision or version tainted, King's work stands on its own as vivid. His paintbrush for painting scenes always ends up relating characters to the East Coast but his vision of Colorado is a bold and beautiful one. And with that beauty, there is the suspected horror that comes with the package deal of a King novel. The characters in the Shining are well rounded, feasible and just a few degrees away from what real monsters are - drinking problems, anger issues, mental health deterioration and the real world cases of an idiomatic term for a claustrophobic reaction cabin fever and isolation. What makes this so horrific is the plausibility of these characters - those they gave you life and now want to take it away from you. This is worth a read - and it is read best by kindlelight in the dark.;His paintbrush for painting scenes always ends up relating characters to the East Coast but his vision of Colorado is a bold and beautiful one.

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R1Y72X5Z1S2U0B;5;Over the summer, I read this book during camp. I had heard about The Shining through all of my friends, and they were all reading it and were telling me how interesting it was. I tried reading the book out, and I fell in love with it! It blew away my expectations. My parents had always told me that this book was a horror book and compared to horror movies, this book was a walk in the park. I have read Stephen King before, so I know how he gives many characters strange traits. I liked how you could not figure out what was wrong with Jack Torrance until the middle of the book. You only knew that he had an incident at his previous job as a teacher. I think that anyone older than 13 can read it because before then, children will not grasp the whole point of the book and about what the characters are speaking of.

But in The Shining as in Pet Semetary the story is clean, dramatic, and suffers from none of King's later unconvincing editorializing and stuffing (talking about Twinkies, pop culture, rock and roll, etc, all of which detracts and kills whatever \horror\"" there is). Let's face it, King's major influence is EC comics, which is not exactly confidence building (imagine Lovecraft had admitted such a thing) but there is nothing \""EC\"" about The Shining. This is essential horror. If King had written nothing else he would have gone down in the history of supernatural horror for this alone. Strangely, The Shining is rarely included in lists of the best horror (e.g. Karl Wagner's).

It is still my favorite King book and I have re-read it many times. So I am sure you can imagine my excitement when I heard that they were finally going to release an audio version.I am sorry to say that this reading does not begin to do the story justice. I found Mr. Scott's interpretation flat and uninspired.  Most of the story is read in an almost monotone voice making one of the scariest books I have ever read a cure for insomnia. What also falls flat is Mr. Scott's attempt to create distinct voices for the characters. None sound convincing and I found the voice he used for Tony almost annoying. Thankfully Tony does not have a large speaking part in the book. They would have done much better to get Steven Weber who starred in the mini series to read.It really is a shame they did not pull out all the stops for the audio version, especially since this really is a one-time shot.

Of all his works of horror, PET SEMATARY stands alone as his most terrifying book. From the very first page, the awful, suffocating dread begins to descend. The idea of losing one's child is frightening enough, but the added supernatural re-animation is absolutely shocking! King has never reached these heights of terror, before or since. King infuses every scene w/ death, like a lurking character in the story. PET SEMATARY takes the reader into places where King rarely (if ever) goes. It's the only book in his catalogue that I would call depressive in mood. Bleak as a famine, dark as hell, and unrelentingly cold, this story actually disturbs.

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R2PZE0M56Q176H;4;Once upon a time, many years ago, I was reading any Stephen King book I could get my hands on.  Everyone told me to skip Pet Semetary as it was a complete waste of time and just ridiculous.  So, I never read it.I believe in timing and that some things happen for reasons and I think that the reason I never read the book then is because I never would have understood it as I have now.  I was amazed at all the great reviews the book received on Amazon and a friend recommended it highly as being one of King's best works.Enough reviewers have described the plot, so I will skip all of that in this review.  Above all, I found this book to be an extremely sad story.  In our never ending pursuit to come to grips with death and loss, King explores all of this vast terrain thru his main charector, Louis Creed.  It is mainly a story of life and death and how we deal (or not!) with the death of our loved ones.For sheer reading enjoyment, this book did not do it for me in the way it seems to have for so many other people.  The going was a bit rough in the beginning.  There are other books by King that I personally have enjoyed much more than this one.  The Dead Zone, It (a masterpiece!!) , The Shining, Salem's Lot.However, that being said, I still am glad that I read it.

Late night reading in bed led to, being ultra sensitive to every creak or sound during the night.This is classic King where you get the chills from imagining the horror and fright, and not all the extra gore and grotesque that some of his other works have now.

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R1TT1FW0CFMMEW;4;"I chose to read this book because of Stephen King's reputation as a great author of horror stories. I felt this was a great book other than the slow and boring beginning. \Pet Semetary\"" is a story about a small family moving from the big city into a small remote town next to a highway where animals that are run over are buried at the pet cemetery up the long trail behind the new house, and the dead pets and animals mysteriously come back to life and haunt the living. The way the novel was written by Stephen King is remarkable. One theme King used in this book was the use of a ghost. For example \""He looked back at Pascow who was dead but somehow not dead.\"" (63) Louis, the main character was sleeping when he woke up to Pascow talking to him. Pascow had died in Louis' office a few days earlier. After the confrontation in the bedroom, Louis followed Pascow up the trail and past the pet cemetery. A useful term King used was \""conversationally.\"" For example\"" Louis asked himself almost conversationally...to his own minds ears\"" (139) The author used this term because Louis does a lot of thinking and tends to ask himself a lot of questions. I would recommend this book to any age because when you pick up this book you can't put it back down.

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R1PT8QOMHE50IL;5;"Title: The ShiningAuthor: Stephen KingGenre: HorrorAge: AdultPart of a Series?: Yes (this is Book 1)*I checked this book out of my local library as part of my MFA studiesOverall Impressions:This book was amazing. And terrifying. BUT...not really terrifying in the way I expected, which actually made it easier for me to read than I had anticipated. I \used\"" Stonecoast as an excuse to \""have\"" to read this book (even though I had other options for the scene pacing seminar I was going to take). Stephen King is, after all, one of the most well-known modern writers and I have NEVER read any of his work. I'm a scaredy cat that way. After reading it, however, it all boiled down to this: I wish I hadn't waited so long.The Nitty Gritty:As I said, this is the first Stephen King book that I have ever read. I have always been scared away by the reputation he has and by how scary his books-turned-movies are. Boy was I wrong to avoid him. This book was captivating from beginning to end. The characters were detailed and rich--including the character that is the hotel. Seriously. Mr. King turned a building into a character. A character with history. Sure, it was a bit one dimensional, but it actually needed to be to fulfill its role in the story. (Yes, I realize that most of the rest of America already knew this, either from the book or the movie or the remake, but I had been living under a rock as far as the horror genre is concerned. No scary movies, books, ghost stories, etc. Prior to reading this book, anyway).You're probably wondering if I'm a horror-phobe and I liked this book, then how scary could it be? Well, it was the scariest thing I've read, and may stay that way for a long time. But what is important about it is the TYPE of scary that it is. It isn't the type where you are lulled into a false sense of security and peace only to have something jump out at you from out of nowhere. It isn't the sort of scary where you feel like you should start locking your doors and checking for \""real\"" serial killer type monsters under bed and in the back seat of your car. And it isn't the type of horror where you believe there is no possible hope of success for the protagonist (such as how I feel when trying to watch The Walking Dead with my husband). No. This book is the kind of scary that is a slow, creeping dread, based entirely on the idea that you care about the characters, they have a chance to survive, but the odds are severely stacked against them. You want them to survive, and you know they might, but you can't help but feel that they don't really have a way out of their bad situation. (And for me, the fact that it is supernatural, and therefore less plausible than say a serial killer, makes it easier for me to deal with.)As for the craft I learned from reading this book, well, there were lots of things I noticed, but as I was reading it for a seminar about \""scenes that move\"" (Amy Tibbets, Stonecoast MFA Winter 2013 graduate), I tried to focus on the way Mr. King built his scenes. While there were definitely some slower scenes, they were relatively few and were sprinkled amidst fast—but appropriately—paced scenes.As I read the book, I noticed that he used brief, easy-to-understand sentences. This is not to say that he lacked the description that is frequently found in longer sentences. He simply used no more words than were necessary to say what needed to be said. Most of the time. As with most long books, there were times that I wished he had chosen a different pacing--both with wanting the book to speed up and slow down. However, his \""scenes that moved\"" were always beautiful in the brevity and precision of the word choices.He also did an excellent job of creating unique, distinct voices for each of his characters. While I would not previously have said that strongly individualized characters would help build strong scenes and intense pacing, I believe that this is in fact one of the key factors for King’s scenes moving forward. With strong characters, you can create movement through the interactions between characters, which in turns creates movements from one scene to the next, keeping the pacing moving forward at a steady pace.Finally, the thing that has stuck with me most over the past two and a half years is the idea of variety. He didn't always have short sentences or long sentences, short scenes or long scenes, but he had all different lengths. More specifically, he used the length of the sentences to simulate the emotions the characters were feeling. If a character was walking across a room, needing to reach the other side as quickly as possible, but feeling a sense of dread, then the sentences and scene would be long, forcing the reader to slow down and really begin to wonder if the character would reach his or her goal. And by matching the scene and sentence pacing to what the characters are going through, it makes it easy for the reader to become immersed in the book, the pages flipping quicker and quicker, the story advancing towards it inevitable ending.My Rating: 5 StarsI loved it and wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. I will probably read it again at some point in the future and it expanded both my willingness to explore outside my comfort zones and, specifically, to explore the horror genre.""";Should Have Read Sooner;Busy Busy Bookwyrm;1556819695

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R28HCXGH9C0A0L;5;I had not seen The Shining movie nor had I read the book until now (at the age of 18). Now that I have read it, I must comment on how impressed I am with the novel. The Shining happens to be the first S.K. novel that I had ever read from cover to cover. I have read several of his short story collections and I tried to read another novel of his, The Stand, but I couldn't finish it because it was too big and boring. Anyways, The Shining is a perfect example of how horror stories should be written. I practically devoured the book after only a week (thats almost 700 pages). I couldn't put it down because of the high level of interest I took in its content. Each scene in the book is described in a brilliant way, which allows the reader to picture it almost perfectly. You almost feel like you are in the story (which is how books should be). I definitely think that The Shining is one of Stephen Kings best works!Zachary B.

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R1BCPIADW95LBS;5;"I started reading on a weekend summer afternoon in 1979 at 5PM.  At 7 PM, I locked all the doors and windows in the house.  At 9 PM, I turned on all the lights, and they stayed on until I completed the book.  One of the few truly \can't put down\"" books I have ever read.A few years later, while stationed at Ft. Riley, KS, a friend borrowed a number of books from me, including The Shining.  That evening when it began to snow, I called him and told him that, not to try to influence him or anything, but the best time to read The Shining was when it snowed.  The next day he called me to curse me for getting him started on that book when he had to get up the next morning.  He was also unable to put it down and had to read it straight through.Unlike the majority of attempts at horror today, the Shining isn't a book that jumps out at you and yells, \""Boo!\""  It's not a friend wrapped up in a bedsheet rapping on walls in an attempt to unnerve you.  It's a story that creeps up on you, little by little, setting the story, giving you characters you want to root for, putting them in increasingly difficult situations until you realize you are turning the pages as quickly as you can in the hopes of \""saving\"" that little boy and his mother from the Monster in the Overlook.Skip the movie by Stanley Kubrick.  Kubrick apparently skipped reading King's tremendously scary novel in hopes of creating a \""classic\"" horror movie and he mostly only uses the trappings of King's work to paint his own work.  But then again, perhaps Kubrick understood that the reason The Shining works, is it takes it's time to set up the stories, the characters and the situation in a way that a two hour movie never could.  And yet, it's not dull, it's not slow starting nor do you get places in the book where you feel that the writer \""padded\"" the story to draw it out a little.  Every scene, every incident, is meticulously and carefully crafted to take you to the next step as quickly as possible but without rushing you.Very possibly King's best, though that is hard to argue regarding a writer with so many excellently written books.""";Scariest book I ever read;Mia_and_Jerry;1556615930

The story is enthralling and unlike other early King stories, has several layers.  Is the book solely about a hotel possessed by evil spirits?

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R38B2940K62154;3;Warning: some spoilers aheadI'm sure it's been said by countless other reviewers, but this book does in fact provide a far more nuanced and compelling portrait of the main character Jack Torrence than the famous and unforgettable 1980 Stanley Kubrick screen adapatation would suggest.I like what King said in his own recent comments on the book-what made the book truly interesting was the idea that Torrence goes insane from a combination of factors-not just a haunted hotel but his own inner demons.  That is suggested in the movie, but my impression is that in the movie Nicholson plays Torrence as someone already on the edge and there is no implication that he had deep love for his family, also no mention of his own abuse at his father's hands.  It's hard to feel that he suddenly went from loving Shelley Duvall to hating her-he seems to have hatred toward her in the beginning of the movie.  The movie works, of course, and has become so iconic it is hard to read this book without thinking of it, but it is very different from the book, enough so to be someone else's story.This is a major problem with the movie and what makes the book so much more effective, moving, and tragic-in the book Torrence truly loves his wife and son and that makes his descent into madness more frightening and depressing.This is really King's gift, to tie horror to recognizable reality and family life, to express some of our own deepest fears through terrifying metaphors, and he does it very well here.  It's also, like most of his books, very exciting and a good page turner.I especially appreciated his character Dick, the African American cook, for some reason in the movie this character was far less important or appealing.  In the book he has real warmth, compassion, intelligence, and a sense of humor-and he doesn't die, unlike in the movie (I wanted to point that out, that's why I warned of spoilers). I think that's important-he's a survivor, like Danny.His story makes the entire novel more interesting and I'm not sure why they made him sort of an idiot in the movie although I could speculate.  I'm sure this isn't true of the 1997 Stephen Weber/Rebecca DeMornay version, since it is said to be closer to King's original vision, but I have yet to see that.  Another positive point of the book is that they give more background to the ghosts, whereas in the Kubrick movie they just show up (e.g., naked elderly woman in tub).  It's scarier if we know their stories, and King tells us them.It was a good read, but if I had some criticism it would be that it dragged on at times and sometimes got too verbose. King is a very talented writer and very interesting to read but he does tend to veer off into certain overly verbose passages that make my eyes glaze over.  But it's a 600+ page book, and about 400 pages are great, so who are we to complain?  Definitely worth the read even if you've seen the movie, is the point.;Very Good;Justice;1557257525

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;R3841TUA73K4SD;5;"Sometimes you'll read a book by a popular author and wonder what all the fuss is about, but occasionally you'll come across a work that proves that this writer is - or at least can be - the real deal. I do like this book better than the movie, and while the movie is praised for all the subtle subliminal touches kubrick supposedly added, I think the book is more subtle than the movie. For example, rather than the famous river of blood from the elevator seen in the movie, the book has the elevator filled with something less stereotypically horror but more effective due to the build-up. Even the mantra \Redrum\"" feels like less of a gimmick in the book because of the stronger focus on Jack Torrance's alcoholism. On the website \""cinemassacre\"" the review of kubrick's \""the shining\"" makes fun of the way it \""tries to scare you over nothing\"" with a loud noise occurring when the word \""tuesday\"" is shown. \""Oh no, not tuesday!\"" jokes the reviewer James Rolfe. However in the book simple chapter titles like \""snow\"" or \""tony\"" do have a big emotional impact because of the places they appear and all the implication king has carefully laden those simple words with by that point in the story.The story is not without flaw, and King doesn't always know when to be subtle and when to be brutally explicit, a problem reminiscent of the roque mallet that features so prominently in the story with one end rubber and the other end hard. King's trademark habit of rambling in brackets to remind us of something else that is scary and related to the currently scary thing happening sometimes feels like the prose equivalent of pounding music in a movie to remind us that a certain scene is supposed to inspire terror when the absence of such cues would probably make it more scary as they would make me feel I'm facing the terrifying thing on my own without the narrator to hold my hand and tell me what I should feel about it. Another slightly distracting feature of King's prose in \""The Shining\"" is that while his writing is frequently beautiful you can tell that he had the thesaurus handy, and it even invades the dialog with Jack Torrance using the word \""dray\"" when being playful with his wife and son. Even with a character who is supposed to be a writer this somehow strained credibility for me. And one of the strongest aspects of the novel for me in the middle weakened the conclusion in my opinion - the scariness of not knowing how much of Jack's transformation to evil murderous maniac is because of the hotel and how much is caused by his own inner demons seems completely obliterated by the way his behavior is handled towards the end of the book. King says in \""On Writing\"" that the scariest villains are those with believable motivations that you can almost relate to and it's quite creepy the way Jack's inner rationalisations which eventually lead him to violence almost seem reasonable, and how the same character we might have seen as sympathetic at the start doesn't seem to have had to change all that much to become the bad guy. But by the end he's painted as a decent guy possessed by a demonic hotel and you almost get the sense that the ending was written before the earlier sections detailing Jack's thoughts as he loses his way. But while flawed this is still a horror novel you need to read, and also a painful mediation on how some of the very things that make a man needed by his family - focus on career, discipline, determination and single-mindedness - can backfire and tear a family apart.""";Wow...;Lee;1557275224

198211598X;Pet Sematary: A Novel;RM691NTJH3RMV;4;On reading the Shining, I found that another one of my favorite movies once again failed to come close to the quality of the novel it was based on.  King's Shinning, althought now a little dated, hits the mark for those looking for an entertaining and frightening read. King quickly pulls his readers into the characters' worlds, allowing time for identifying with them before the fun (or terror) begins. The Shinings biggest character is in fact the haunted mountain top hotel called the Overlook and Kings writing allows the reader to clearly see this cursed venue in the mind's eye. The books enjoyment is greatly enhanced if read alone, at night, and during the dark winter months.But, as in many of King's novels, he tends to end his story in a rushed and haphazard way, tieing up his loose ends a little to conveniently. The Shining is a great example of this, which is why 4/5 stars are given.With that said, I still consider The Shining one of his best and a must read for any horror fan.;What is REDRUM spelled backwards?!
